The US assessment of the worth of the deposits was completed in December last year.\nThe trillion dollar calculation was reported in the New York Times on 14 June.\nThe BBC's Jill McGivering says that at a time of growing despair about Afghanistan and its government, the portrayal of the country as a potential goldmine could help to bolster international resolve and paint the country as a prize worth fighting for.\nLithium is an increasingly vital resource, used in batteries for everything from mobile phones to laptops and key to the future of the electric car. Bolivia boasts the largest reserves.\nAfghanistan also has significant reserves of niobium, a key ingredient in hardened steel.\nMinistry of mines spokesman Jawad Omar said he could not confirm the exact value of Afghanistan's mineral wealth but had no doubt it would have a very big impact on the country's development.\nIf exploited, Afghanistan would become self-sufficient, he said, and no longer need foreign aid.\nPresident Hamid Karzai's spokesman, Waheed Omar, was quoted by news agency AP as saying: \"The result of the survey ... has shown that Afghanistan has mineral resources worth $1 trillion.\n\"This is not an overall survey of all minerals in Afghanistan.

{"document": "The pirates are very good at what they do. They run sophisticated operations using the latest hi-tech equipment such as satellite phones and GPS.\nThey are also heavily armed with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s. The pirates are known to receive tip-offs from contacts at ports in the Gulf of Aden.\nThey use speedboats with very powerful outboard motors to approach their target. Sometimes the speedboats are launched from much larger \"mother ships\" on the high seas and they have even managed to seize enormous oil tankers.\nWith warships patrolling along the Somali coast, the pirates have started to operate further away and have even staged some attacks across the Indian Ocean, closer to India than Somalia.\nTo actually hijack the ships, the pirates first use grappling hooks and irons - some of which are even rocket-propelled - and climb aboard using ropes and ladders. The pirates have also on occasion fired at the ships to scare them into stopping, so it is easier for them to board the vessel.\nThe pirates then sail the hijacked ship to their base, often the town of Eyl. There, pirates usually take the hostages ashore where they are normally well looked after until a ransom is paid.\nThe International Maritime Bureau (IMB) is advising ship owners to adopt measures such as having lookouts or travelling at speeds which would allow them to outrun the pirates.\nHowever, the pirates move extremely quickly and often at night and so it is sometimes too late before the crew has realised what has happened.\nOnce the pirates have taken control of a ship, military intervention is complicated because of the hostages on board.\nThere is also no international legal system for people accused of piracy. Although some have been put on trial in Kenya, the government says it is unfair if all the pirate suspects are sent there.\nOne group has been jailed in the Netherlands - in Europe's first such case - while another group has been sentenced to death in Yemen. A trial in the US in 2010, meanwhile, convicted five men of piracy for an attack on a US Navy ship.\nBut pirates apprehended on the high seas are also frequently released because of the difficulties of prosecuting them.\nSome argue an international court is needed, backed by the UN, with perhaps even an international prison for those convicted.\nThe UN Security Council has approved a resolution allowing countries to pursue Somali pirates on land as well as at sea - an extension of the powers countries already have to enter Somali waters to chase pirates.\nBut as long as Somalia continues to exist without an effective government, many believe lawlessness within the country and off its lengthy coast will only grow.\nThe IMB estimates that 53 ships were hijacked worldwide in 2010 - 49 of them off Somalia's coast - and says a record 1,181 hostages were taken.\nThe problem also appears to be growing. Overall, there were 445 pirate attacks in 2010, a 10% rise from 2009, the IMB says.\nMeanwhile, maritime piracy costs the global economy between $7bn (\u00c2\u00a34.4bn) and $12bn (\u00c2\u00a37.6bn) a year, according to a separate study by a US think tank.\nThe problem is a massive headache for shipping companies, who pass on the extra costs - security, higher insurance premiums, ransoms and extra fuel for longer routes - resulting from the pirate threat to consumers.\nThe head of the European Union naval force tackling the pirates, Navfor, says he is worried that the pirates have been able to hugely expand their field of operations.\nHowever, he also thinks the presence of the warships has made a difference.\nLast year, Navfor said the pirates' success ratio - the number of successful hijackings versus the number attempted - had dropped from 50% a few years ago to 20-30%.\nFor the money. The pirates treat the ship, its cargo and its crew as hostages and hold them for ransom.\nThe rewards they receive are rich in a country where there are no jobs and almost half the population needs food aid after two decades of non-stop conflict.\nThe Kenyan foreign minister estimates pirates received $150m in ransom payments in 2009.\nThey use some of this money to fund future operations - more powerful weapons, bigger, faster boats and more sophisticated equipment.\nSome of the pirates are former fishermen, who say they have been put out of business by trawlers from around the world taking advantage of the lack of government in Somalia to scoop up all the fish in its territorial waters.", "summary": "Pirates have been operating in the Gulf of Aden, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, for several years, prompting world powers to send their navies to safeguard international trade.", "id": "10349155"}

At the same time, the snake's intestine expanded, its gall bladder shrank and its heart increased in volume by 25%.\nThe researchers, Henrik Lauridsen and Kasper Hansen, both from Aarhus University in Denmark, explained that the increase in the size of the snake's heart was probably associated with the energy it needed to digest its meal.\n\"It's a sit and wait predator,\" explained Mr Lauridsen. \"It fasts for months and then eats a really large meal.\n\"It can eat the equivalent of up to 50% of its own bodyweight, and in order to get the energy out of the meal, it has to restart the intestinal system very fast.\"\nThe researchers, who are both based at the university's Department of Zoophysiology and the MR Research Centre at Aarhus, say that their approach has several advantages over the \"subjective and sometimes misleading\" interpretations of dissections.\nDissection induces changes, explained Dr Hansen. \"For example, after opening the dense bone of a turtle shell, the lungs will collapse due to the change in pressure.\n\"And to use these techniques you don't have to kill the animal,\" he added. \"We can do this using live animals and revisit the results over and over again.\"\nThe images, they say, will be valuable tools in future studies of animal anatomy for both research and education.\nAs part of the project, they have produced similarly spectacular images of several other species, including frogs, alligators, turtles, swamp eels and bearded dragons.", "summary": "Scientists have used the latest imaging techniques to look inside a python that had just swallowed a rat whole.", "id": "10487548"}

He killed five and seriously injured half a dozen others.\nBut the Ministry of Defence is anxious to highlight how rare these kinds of incidents are.\nSince 2006, British forces have trained 130,000 Afghan troops. Some 5,000 of the 10,000 British servicemen currently deployed in Afghanistan are working alongside members of the Afghan Security forces day in and day out.\nThe training and mentoring of Afghanistan's army and police is essential to the goal of eventually leaving an Afghanistan capable of looking after its own security.\nThat is why Liam Fox is stressing that, despite this tragedy, British forces will \"continue to work shoulder to shoulder with the Afghans\" and will not be deterred.\nRoyal Marine dies in Afghanistan\nMr Cameron said he spoke to President Karzai on Tuesday morning and both men agreed that an urgent investigation was required.\nPresident Karzai's spokesman, Waheed Omar, said the Afghanistan government was also investigating the killings and the government would \"do everything to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice\".\nThe BBC understands that one of the soldiers killed was shot and the other two were killed by a rocket-propelled grenade.\nThere is a helpline number in the UK for concerned relatives - 08457 800900.\nThe spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Lt Col James Carr-Smith, said: \"We believe these were the actions of a lone individual who has betrayed his Isaf and Afghan comrades.\n\"His whereabouts are currently unknown but we are making strenuous efforts to find him.

They will be greatly missed and their actions will not be forgotten. We will remember them.\"\nBritish soldiers in Afghanistan have trained 130,000 Afghan troops since 2006, and 5,000 British troops are currently partnering members of the ANA.\nIt appears to be the third incident in which a member of the Afghan security forces has opened fire on British troops.\nReaction to deaths of UK soldiers\nThere was one incident in 2008 when two British soldiers were shot in the leg, and another in November 2009 when five British soldiers were shot dead by an Afghan policeman.\nSecurity correspondent Frank Gardner said he was not surprised that the attack had happened because the vetting process to join the Afghan military is poor. It is not a popular career move, he said, because it is poorly paid and dangerous.\n\"It is important to keep an open mind about what has motivated this person,\" said our correspondent.\n\"This kind of thing often has rather more below the surface. There are often tribal feuds, there are family feuds; there are personal reasons. So it isn't always down to the insurgency.\"\nOur correspondent added that the tragedy was likely to intensify debate over the human costs of the mission in Afghanistan, but he said the West's exit strategy relies on training the Afghan security forces.\nThe Nato commander in Afghanistan, Gen David Petraeus, said: \"This is a combined joint mission - Afghan and Alliance troopers fighting shoulder to shoulder against the Taliban and other extremists.\n\"We have sacrificed greatly together and we must ensure the trust between our forces remains solid in order to defeat our common enemies.\"\nAnd Col Richard Kemp, a former commander of British troops in Afghanistan, told the BBC it was important to remember that this was an isolated incident and \"not a pattern of events\".", "summary": "Three British soldiers have been killed and four injured by a renegade Afghan soldier in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence said.", "id": "10610068"}

Many pundits were shocked by the result, given Mr Abbott's gaffe-prone history.\nAs leader of the opposition, Mr Abbott's aggressive approach earned him several nicknames. His tactics led some to call him \"Tear-down Tony\" or \"Mad Monk\" - a reference to his time spent training as a priest.\nHe has also consistently voted against relaxing laws on abortion, same-sex marriages and stem cell research.\nHis stance on social issues, and his poor polling among women, has led some to say that Mr Abbott has a \"women problem\".

{"document": "As communist regimes collapsed across the world, Castro kept the red flag flying right on the doorstep of his greatest enemy, the United States.\nA divisive figure, his supporters praised him as a champion of socialism, the soldier-politician who had given Cuba back to the people.\nBut he faced accusations of brutally suppressing opposition and pursuing policies that crippled the Cuban economy.\nFidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on 13 August 1926, the illegitimate son of a wealthy farmer, Angel Mar\u00c3\u00ada Bautista Castro y Argiz, who had emigrated to Cuba from Spain.\nHis mother, Lina Ruz Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez was a farm servant who became his father's mistress, and later, after Fidel's birth, his wife.\nCastro attended Catholic schools in Santiago before going on to the Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belen in Havana.\nHowever, he failed to excel academically, preferring to spend his time in sporting activities.\nIt was while studying law at Havana University in the mid-1940s that he became a political activist, honing his skills as a passionate public speaker.\nHis targets included the Cuban government, led by the president Ramon Grau, which was mired in accusations of corruption.\nViolent protests became the order of the day and Castro found himself targeted by the police.\nHe also became part of a plot to overthrow Rafael Trujillo, the right-wing leader of the Dominican Republic but the attempt was thwarted after US intervention.\nIn 1948 Castro married Mirta Diaz-Balart, the daughter of a wealthy Cuban politician. Far from encouraging him to join the country's elite, he turned increasingly to Marxism.\nHe believed Cuba's economic problems were a result of unbridled capitalism that could only be solved by a people's revolution.\nAfter graduating Castro set up a legal practice but it failed to prosper and he was continually in debt. He remained a political activist, taking part in a series of often violent demonstrations.\nIn 1952 Fulgencio Batista launched a military coup which overthrew the government of the Cuban president, Carlos Pr\u00c3\u00ado.\nBatista's policy of closer ties with the United States and the suppression of socialist organisations ran counter to Castro's fundamental political beliefs.\nAfter legal challenges had failed Castro formed an organisation called The Movement, which worked underground in a bid to overthrow the Batista regime.\nCuba had become a haven for the playboy rich, and was run largely by organised crime syndicates. Prostitution, gambling and drug trafficking were endemic.\nIn July 1953 Castro planned an attack on the Moncada army barracks near Santiago in order to seize weapons for use in an armed uprising.\nThe attack failed and many revolutionaries were killed or captured. Castro was one of a  number of prisoners who went on trial in September 1953.\nCastro used his court appearance to expose atrocities committed by the army which further raised his profile, particularly among members of the foreign press who were allowed to attend the hearing.\nHe was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In the event he was released in a general amnesty in May 1955 having served just 19 months in relatively comfortable conditions.\nDuring his short time in prison he divorced his wife and immersed himself in Marxist texts.\nAs Batista continued to crack down on his opponents, Castro fled to Mexico to avoid being arrested. There he met a young revolutionary named  Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara.\nIn November 1956 Castro returned to Cuba with 81 armed companions on board a leaking cabin cruiser designed to carry just 12 people.\nThe party took refuge in the Sierra Maestra mountains. From this base Castro launched a two-year guerrilla campaign against the regime in Havana.\nOn 2 January, 1959, the rebel army entered the Cuban capital and Batista fled.\nHundreds of Batista's former supporters were executed after trials that many foreign observers deemed as less than fair.\nCastro responded by insisting that \"revolutionary justice is not based on legal precepts, but on moral conviction\".\nThe new Cuban government promised to give the land back to the people and to defend the rights of the poor.\nBut the government quickly imposed a one-party system. Hundreds of people were sent to jail and labour camps as political prisoners. Thousands of mainly middle class Cubans fled into exile.\nCastro insisted his ideology was, first and foremost, Cuban.\n\"There is not communism or Marxism, but representative democracy and social justice in a well-planned economy,\" he said at the time.\nIn 1960, Fidel Castro nationalised all US-owned businesses on the island. In response, Washington put Cuba under a trade embargo that was to last into the 21st century.\nCastro claimed he was driven into the arms of the Soviet Union and its leader, Nikita Khrushchev, although some commentators say he entered the USSR's embrace willingly.\nWhatever the motive, tropical Cuba became a Cold War battleground.\nIn April 1961, the US attempted to topple the Castro government by recruiting a private army of Cuban exiles to invade the island.\nAt the Bay of Pigs, Cuban troops repulsed the invaders, killing many and capturing 1,000. Fidel Castro had bloodied the nose of a superpower and it would never forgive him.\nA year later, American reconnaissance planes discovered Soviet missiles on their way to sites in Cuba. The world was suddenly staring into the abyss of all-out nuclear war.\n\"A series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western hemisphere,\" warned President John F Kennedy.\nThe superpowers stood eyeball to eyeball, but it was President Khrushchev who blinked first, pulling his missiles out of Cuba in return for a secret withdrawal of US weapons from Turkey.\nFidel Castro, though, had become America's enemy number one. The CIA tried to assassinate him, most infamously with Operation Mongoose. Getting him to smoke a cigar packed with explosives was one idea.\nOthers were even more bizarre, including one to make his beard fall out and make him into a figure to be ridiculed.\nThe Soviet Union poured money into Cuba. It bought the bulk of the island's sugar harvest and in return its ships crammed into Havana harbour, bringing in desperately needed goods to beat the US trade embargo.\nDespite his reliance on the Soviets' help, Castro put Cuba at the head of the newly-emerging Non-Aligned Movement.\nHowever, he also took sides, especially in Africa, sending his troops to support Marxist guerrillas in Angola and Mozambique.\nBy the mid-1980s, however, global geopolitics were shifting. It was the era of Mikhail Gorbachev, glasnost and perestroika, and it proved catastrophic for Castro's revolution.\nMoscow effectively pulled the plug on the Cuban economy by refusing to take its sugar any more.\nStill under the US embargo and with its Soviet lifeline cut off, chronic shortages and empty shelves in Cuba were inevitable. Tempers grew shorter as the food queues grew longer.\nThe country Fidel Castro called the most advanced in the world had, in fact, returned to the age of ox-drawn carts.\nBy the mid-1990s, many Cubans had had enough. If earlier waves of exiles had been as much about politics as economics, thousands were now taking to the sea in a waterborne exodus to Florida and the dream of a better life. Many drowned but it was a crushing vote of no-confidence in Castro.\nYet Cuba registered some impressive domestic achievements. Good medical care was freely available for all, and Cuba's infant mortality rates compared favourably with the most sophisticated societies on earth.\nIn later years, Castro seemed to have mellowed. 1998 saw a ground-breaking visit by Pope John Paul II, something which would have been unthinkable even five years earlier.\nThe then Pope condemned Cuba for its human rights abuses, embarrassing Castro in front of the world's media.\nFidel Castro had created his own unique brand of Caribbean communism which, in his last years, he was forced to adapt, slowly introducing a few free-market reforms to save his revolution.\nOn 31 July 2006, just days before his 80th birthday, Castro handed over power temporarily to Raul after undergoing emergency intestinal surgery.\nHis health continued to deteriorate. Early in 2008, Castro announced that he would not accept the positions of president and commander-in chief at the next meeting of the National Assembly.\nIn a letter published in an official communist newspaper, he was quoted as saying: \"It would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total devotion, that I am not in a physical condition to offer.\"\nHe largely withdrew from public life, writing articles published in the state media under the title Reflections of Comrade Fidel.\nHe re-emerged in July 2010, he made his first public appearance since falling ill, greeting workers and giving a television interview in which he discussed US tensions with Iran and North Korea.\nThe following month Castro gave his first speech to the National Assembly in four years, urging the US not to take military action against Iran or North Korea and warning of a nuclear holocaust if tensions increased.\nWhen asked whether Castro may be re-entering government, culture minister Abel Prieto told the BBC: \"I think that he has always been in Cuba's political life but he is not in the government. He has been very careful about that. His big battle is international affairs.\"\nPresident Obama's announcement in December 2014 of the beginning of an end to US trade and other sanctions saw the beginning of a thaw in what had been half a century of hostile relations between the two countries.\nCastro welcomed the move stating it was it was \"a positive move for establishing peace in the region\", but that he mistrusted the US government.\nWhile many Cubans undoubtedly detested Castro, others genuinely loved him. They saw him as a David who could stand up to the Goliath of America, who successfully spat in the \"Yanqui\" eye.\nFor them Castro was Cuba and Cuba was Castro.", "summary": "Fidel Castro ruled Cuba as a one party state for almost half a century.", "id": "10744408"}

The commissioner will also set the amount of the \"precept\" that their local electors have to pay, the part of police funding collected through the council tax.\nThe chief constable will appoint all other officers and will \"retain responsibility for the direction and control of the police force\".\nThe police commissioner takes over the responsibilities of the current police authorities - but they will have the additional power of being able to sack a chief constable. Under the current system, chiefs are appointed by the force's police authority in consultation with the Home Office.\nEach force in England and Wales outside of London will elect a police commissioner in May 2012. The commissioners will be able to hold office for two terms.\nLondon is being treated differently because the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is Britain's top police officer with national duties including co-ordinating counter-terrorism. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner is appointed directly by the Home Secretary who has to take the view of the Mayor of London into account.\nPolice Authorities will be scrapped. Instead, they will be replaced by a new body called a policing and crime panel. Police authorities oversee the budget and workings of a force and are comprised of local councillors, magistrates and other independent members.\nThe new panels will scrutinise the work of the commissioner, rather than the chief constable. They will comprise local councillors and other co-opted members.\nIn its original consultation on the future of policing, ministers said they wanted to see the \"police family extended\" by encouraging more people to volunteer to help out. In the 1950s, there were almost 70,000 Special Constables in the UK. Today, there are about 14,000.\nThe government says it wants a \"step change\" in the level of volunteering and is also asking people what they think about a new category called police reservists. The government has not spelled out the role of a reservist, what powers they would have, or how that would differ to the specials.\nSecondly, ministers suggest that local people could take part in \"joint patrols with the police, looking out for their neighbours\". it's not clear at this stage whether any of thes\nThe other pillar of the proposed reforms is at the opposite end of the policing spectrum and concerns tackling organised crime.

The NCA, which will have a chief constable and two key \"commands\" - one focusing on organised crime and the other on border policing.\nIt will have its own officers but will also be involved in the \"tasking\" of local forces who are involved in the same kind of work. For instance, there are 3,000 officers around the UK involved in border work.\nIn theory, the NCA will better co-ordinate their efforts. This model has worked successfully in counter-terrorism where there is a national co-ordinator in the Metropolitan Police who draws on teams based in forces around the UK. Policing is devolved in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The NCA is expected to have some kind of responsibilities with bodies in those parts of the UK - but the exact relationship and jurisdiction remains to be decided.\nMinisters have considered but ruled out two alternatives to the NCA.\nThe first would have been mergers to create regional police forces, which would have met local opposition.

they defecated, had sex and engaged in violent battles for dominance.\nEventually, in 1972, after 14 rejections, the publisher Rex Collings saw the potential and agreed to take it on with an initial print run of 2,500 copies.\nIt was hailed as a children's classic, going on to sell more than 50 million copies, helped along by readings on BBC radio, and a dramatic performance in London's Regent's Park.\nWatership Down sold particularly well in the US where canny distributors placed it on the adult publishing list.\nOn his promotional tours across the Atlantic, Adams played the American idea of the archetypical Englishman, wearing a bowler hat and insisting on English marmalade and mustard wherever he went.\nThe book, and a subsequent animated film in 1978, became synonymous with rabbits and at least one enterprising butcher advertised: \"You've read the book, you've seen the film, now eat the cast.\"\nInevitably it attracted criticism from some highbrow reviewers. \"There is something to be said for myxomatosis,\" was one caustic comment.\nThe sudden flow of wealth enabled Adams to retire from the civil service and become a full-time writer.\nIt also drove him into tax exile on the Isle of Man, although he later returned to his roots in southern England.\nBy the time Watership Down was published, he was already writing his second book Shardik, the novel he considered his best work.\nIt is an epic tale of a bear who is a god in an imaginary world and who is abused by the humans in the story.\nShardik did not find favour among critics with some describing it as \"preachy\", a judgement with which Adams did not disagree.\nHis commitment to animal welfare was expressed in his third novel, The Plague Dogs, an outspoken attack on animal experimentation.\nHe admitted that his indignation about vivisection might have got the better of him but the book became another best-seller.\nHe became president of the RSPCA but his attempts to persuade the charity to adopt a more campaigning stance did not find favour with some of the more conservative members of the ruling council.\nHe resigned just ahead of a vote which would have severely curtailed his presidential powers.\nDespite his campaigning for animals he insisted he was not a sentimentalist.\nHe refused to condemn a decision to gas rabbits on the real Watership Down in 1998 after their burrows began undermining the hill.\n\"If I saw a rabbit in my garden I'd shoot it,\" he once said.\nIn all, he wrote more than 20 books, including The Girl in a Swing, a ghostly love story with an undercurrent of eroticism, and a prequel to Shardik - entitled Maia - which was criticised for its sexual and sado-masochistic content.\nNone of these books achieved the success of Watership Down and even a 1997 sequel, Tales from Watership Down, failed to capture the magic of the original.\nRichard Adams was essentially a traditional Englishman with a love of the countryside and a belief that, somehow, things were better in the past.\nIt is perhaps surprising that this natural conservative, from a conventional middle-class background, should have written a book which had such a revolutionary impact on children's literature.", "summary": "Once upon a time there was a middle-aged civil servant who told his children a story about rabbits.", "id": "10788325"}

{"document": "It emerged with the help of Iran during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in the early 1980s, though its ideological roots stretch back to the Shia Islamic revival in Lebanon in the 1960s and '70s.\nAfter Israel withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah resisted pressure to disarm and continued to strengthen its military wing, the Islamic Resistance. In some ways, its capabilities now exceed those of the Lebanese army, its considerable firepower used against Israel in the 2006 war.\nThe group also gradually became a key power broker in Lebanon's political system, and has effectively gained veto power in the cabinet.\nHezbollah has been accused of carrying out a string of bombings and plots against Jewish and Israeli targets and is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League.\nSome Lebanese consider Hezbollah a threat to the country's stability, but it is enduringly popular within the Shia community.\nHezbollah's precise origins are difficult to pinpoint, but its precursors emerged following the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in response to attacks by Palestinian militants in 1982, when Shia leaders favouring a militant response broke away from the leading Amal movement.\nThe new organisation, Islamic Amal, received considerable military and organisational support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley, and emerged as the most prominent and effective of the Shia militias that would later form Hezbollah.\nThe groups launched attacks on the Israeli military and its ally, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), as well as foreign powers in Lebanon. They are believed to have been behind the bombings of the US embassy and US Marine barracks in 1983, which together left 258 Americans and 58 French servicemen dead, and led Western peacekeeping forces to withdraw.\nIn 1985, Hezbollah officially announced its establishment by publishing an \"open letter\" that identified the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's principal enemies and called for the \"obliteration\" of Israel, which it said was occupying Muslim lands.\nIt also called for the \"adoption of the Islamic system on the basis of free and direct selection of the people, not the basis of forceful imposition\".\nThe 1989 Taif Accord that ended Lebanon's civil war and called for the disarmament of militias prompted Hezbollah to rebrand its military wing as an \"Islamic Resistance\" force dedicated to ending Israel's occupation, allowing it to keep its weapons.\nAfter the Syrian military imposed peace on Lebanon in 1990, Hezbollah continued its guerrilla war in South Lebanon, but also began to play an active role in Lebanese politics. In 1992, it successfully participated in national elections for the first time.\nWhen Israeli forces finally withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah was credited with pushing them out. The group resisted pressure to disarm and maintained its military presence in the South, claiming as justification the continued Israeli presence in the Shebaa Farms and other disputed areas.\nIn 2006, Hezbollah militants launched a cross-border attack in which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two others kidnapped, triggering a massive Israeli response.\nIsraeli warplanes bombed Hezbollah strongholds in the South and in Beirut's southern suburbs, while Hezbollah fired about 4,000 rockets at Israel. More than 1,125 Lebanese, most of them civilians, died during the 34-day conflict, as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 45 civilians.\nHezbollah survived the war and emerged emboldened. Although it is has since upgraded and expanded its arsenal and recruited scores of new fighters, there has been no major flare-up along the border area, which is now patrolled by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese army.\nIn 2008, when Lebanon's Western-backed government moved to shut down Hezbollah's private telecommunications network and remove Beirut airport's security chief over ties to the group, Hezbollah responded by seizing much of the capital and fighting rival Sunni groups.\nTo end the sectarian clashes that left 81 people dead and brought Lebanon to the brink of a new civil war, the government backed down and a power-sharing agreement gave Hezbollah and its allies the power to veto any cabinet decision.\nIn 2009 elections it won 10 seats in parliament and remained in the unity government.\nLater that year, Hezbollah's secretary general Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah issued a new political manifesto that sought to highlight the group's \"political vision\".\nIt dropped the reference to an Islamic republic found in the 1985 manifesto, but maintained a tough line against Israel and the US and said Hezbollah needed to keep its weapons.\nIn 2011, the group and its allies forced the collapse of the unity government led by Saad Hariri, a Saudi-backed Sunni, with Hezbollah warning that it would not stand by as four of its members were accused of involvement in the 2005 assassination of Mr Hariri's father Rafik.\nHezbollah and its allies have continued to be part of subsequent governments, where they wield considerable influence.\nAs the war in Syria escalated, thousands of Hezbollah militants went to fight for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, proving decisive in helping pro-government forces recover ground lost to rebels, particularly along the Lebanese border.\nHezbollah's involvement in Syria, however, has sharpened sectarian tensions in Lebanon, where the group has been targeted in a series of bombings by Sunni militants.\nIts support for Syria's Shia Alawite president and alliance with Iran has also seen a deepening of hostility from Gulf Arab states, led by Iran's main regional rival, Saudi Arabia.\nIn early 2016, Saudi Arabia led Gulf countries and the Arab League to declare Hezbollah a terrorist group, accusing it of \"hostile acts\".", "summary": "Hezbollah - the Party of God - is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon.", "id": "10814698"}

{"document": "Thirty years ago, the boy from the Gellideg estate challenged Mexican Lupe Pintor for his WBC Bantamweight belt.\nDespite defying the odds to dominate the early stages of the fight, he was knocked out in the 12th round, never to regain consciousness again.\nIn a typically hard-fought battle for life, he survived for another two months, but on 4 November 1980, Johnny Owen eventually succumbed to his terrible head injuries.\nBorn to a large Merthyr family, Johnny soon learned to stick up for himself, and started his interest in boxing aged just eight.\nHe was to remain in the amateur sport until he was 20, an unusually long time by modern standards; winning 106 of his 124 bouts.\nHe fought for Wales 17 times, and was victorious on 15 occasions.\nYet despite this impressive record, Merthyr boxing writer and professional referee, Winford Jones, says that Johnny's true talent didn't lie in the shorter format of the sport.\n\"Johnny was a machine. His great skill wasn't his strength - though he never took a backwards step and could punch as hard as anyone of his weight - it was his stamina.\n\"He could fight for hours, and would wear opponents down by outlasting them.  You could see this talent far more in 12 and 15-round professional fights, than you could in the three rounds allowed in amateur boxing.\"\nHis professional career lasted just four years, from 1976 to 1980, but in that time Johnny Owen crammed in 28 fights; winning 25, drawing one and losing two.\nThough in a sense it is possible to argue that he never lost fair and square.\nHis first defeat came against Spain's Juan Francisco Rodriguez, in a fight for the European belt.\nIn what's now widely regarded by experts to have been a travesty of a home-town decision, the judges awarded Rodriguez a fight which Owen had clearly bossed.\nHis second, and final defeat came in the fatal clash with Pintor, a  fight in which he at least held his own, and may have won, were it not for the head injuries which he'd sustained.\nBut at one stage Owen's record read 22-0, winning his first fight against a former Welsh champion, George Sutton.\nIn his sixth fight he again saw off Sutton to claim the Welsh title.\nBy bout nine he had the British belt, beating Paddy Maguire, and in November 1978 he became the Commonwealth champion, stopping Italian-Australian Paul Ferreri.\nOwen wasted no time in avenging the controversial defeat to Rodriguez in the spring of 1979.\nJust a year later he convincingly bettered him in a re-match in Ebbw Vale, setting up his World title chance against Pintor.\nWinford Jones was lucky enough to referee some of those early fights.\n\"In what I think must have been his fourth or fifth fight, I remember he was taking on an Irish lad, and I had to stop it in the fourth round because Johnny was murdering him.\n\"It makes you think about what happened a few years later on to Johnny.\n\"But he was fearless, you could tell, even then, that he had the makings of a champion, and sadly the potential to get hurt, because he would never give in, and never take a backward step in a fight.\"\nYet the man who was so fearless in the ring, was the shyest and most awkward of characters in the glare of the media.\nProfessional life\nInconceivable in modern boxing, Owen would simply shake hands with his opponent at a weigh-in, avoiding confrontation, and usually conversation of any kind.\nHe declined requests for all but a tiny handful of interviews.  Perhaps boxing journalist Hugh McIlvanney summed it up best, when he wrote: \"The tragedy of Johnny Owen was that he was only articulate in the most deadly of languages.\"\nWhen Owen was knocked down in the ninth round of the WBC title-challenge in Los Angeles, it was the first time he'd been on the canvas in his professional life.\nBut he was to go down twice more in the 12th round, never getting up from the second.\nThe legacy of Johnny Owen lives on in Merthyr.\nAfter he died, a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 relief fund raised for his care, went instead, according to his family's wishes, to establish a special-care baby unit at the town's Prince Charles Hospital.\nImportant safety lessons were learned, when it became evident from his post mortum, that Johnny had been born with a critical weakness of his skull.\nWhilst boxing will never be entirely safe, the routine scans introduced following Johnny's death, have undoubtedly saved many other lives.\nRather than bitterness, his family extended a hand of friendship and solidarity in boxing to Lupe Pintor, telegraphing him shortly after Johnny's death, to urge him not to feel guilty, and to continue boxing.\nMutual respect\nIn 2002, on the 22nd anniversary of Owen's death, his father Dick unveiled a statue of his son in Merthyr, arm-in-arm with Pintor.\nWinford Jones said was it was one of the most moving experiences of his life.\n\"Before the unveiling, I asked Lupe, in my scratchy Spanish, how he was finding the day, and he replied 'Very awkward'.\n\"But he'd come nevertheless, and the people of Merthyr gave him a tremendous reception.  I think that speaks volumes for Merthyr, and in particular for Lupe and Dick.\"\n\"I cried when I saw them hug in front of Johnny's statue.\n\"That is an image that all boxers should be shown before they set a toe in a ring, as it encapsulated the honour and mutual respect that should always be present in the sport.\"", "summary": "In the firmament of Welsh boxing legends, no star has burned so brightly, or for such a tragically short time, as the \"Merthyr Matchstick\", Johnny Owen.", "id": "11334993"}

He later died of his injuries, although an intern who was also shot, Carlos Sanchez, survived the attack.\n\"The loss of two reporters from this publishing house in less than two years represents an irreparable sorrow for all of us who work here, and, in particular, for their families,\" the newspaper said.\nDescribing the drug lords as the \"de facto authorities\" within Ciudad Juarez, the newspaper asked the cartels: \"We ask you to explain what you want from us, what we should try to publish or not publish, so we know what to expect.\"\nIt highlighted the lack of progress in the investigation into the 2008 death of Armando Rodriguez, shot dead outside his home in view of his family.\nBut the editorial insisted it was not \"a surrender\", saying instead that it had simply become \"impossible to do our job in these conditions\".\nSpeaking to BBC World Service an editor at El Diario, Gerardo Rodriguez, said there was a war going on in Mexico that the journalists did not ask for. He expressed anger at the lack of progress in the official investigation into Mr Rodriguez's death and criticised the government as well as the cartels.\n\"We are looking for a peace agreement. No story is worth the life of anyone anymore.\"\nThe newspaper had not decided to stop publishing stories on the drug war, Mr Rodriguez said, but would consider doing so if the answer that came from the cartels indicated that was their wish.\nDescribing El Diario as a \"very aggressive\" organisation that \"searches for the truth\", he conceded that the paper might have to scale back its work if the violence did not stop.\n\"We may consider stopping in exchange for the lives of our reporters.\"\nCarlos Lauria, of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said El Diario's decision was a cause for regret.\n\"Even in one of the places where violence is worst...

It also killed high-profile figures, including Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa.\nAfter various peace initiatives and ceasefires failed, the government launched a final offensive in 2009 and defeated the Tigers.\nUntil the final months of the war, the death toll for more than 25 years of conflict was estimated to be about 70,000.\nBut the final phase, when the government and rebels battled it out as thousands of civilians were hemmed in to a tiny strip of land on the north-eastern coast, has been the subject of most scrutiny.\nEstimates range from 20,000-75,000 killed in the final assault, but a government estimate put the figure at about 9,000.\nA 2011 UN report said hospitals, UN centres and ships belonging to the Red Cross were deliberately targeted by the army.\nThe government was accused of using heavy weaponry and UN images obtained by the BBC appeared to show shelling damage in a government-designated \"safe zone\" for civilians.\nThe report also accused the Tamil Tigers of using civilians as human shields, saying the rebels shot those who tried to escape.

{"document": "Just as the founder of the state, Kim Il-sung (\"The Great Leader\"), brought his son Kim Jong-il to the fore 30 years ago, so Kim Jong-il (\"The Dear Leader\") has now made clear his choice of his youngest son Kim Jong-un (to be known as \"The Brilliant Comrade\") to be his successor.\nThe difference may lie in the timing. Kim Jong-il's elevation to the status of heir apparent was in 1980, but it was not until his father died in 1994 that he formally took over power.\nIt seems unlikely that Kim Jong-un, who is about 27 (such basic personal details can be absurdly difficult to pin down in North Korea), will have to wait that long.\nThe present leader, who is 68, is widely thought to be a sick man, who may well have suffered a stroke in 2008. There has been speculation that the reason for delaying the present gathering of the ruling Workers' Party for a fortnight, a remarkable and slightly humiliating change for the North Korean leadership, was that he was ill once again.\nIf Kim Jong-il's health is indeed failing fast, this may explain why an apparently wide-ranging reshuffle of the leadership structure has emerged at this party meeting.\nIn the space of a few hours his son, Kim Jon-un, who has no military or political experience whatever, became a four-star general, deputy chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party, and a member of the Central Committee.\nGuide: Secretive 'first family'\nTo bolster his position, the younger Kim's aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was also made a general, as well as a member of the politburo.\nHer husband, Chang Song-taek, is head of the National Defence Commission, and is usually regarded as the power behind the throne. Most of the seats on the politburo have been empty for years;  it is possible they may now slowly be filled.\nBehind this may lie a determined effort to assert the control of the Workers' Party over the military, who have traditionally been the leading power in North Korea.\nIf that is so, it seems likely that the hand of China lies behind much of this. The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, rather than the foreign ministry, seems to be in charge of China's policy towards North Korea.\nThere have been clear signs that China would like North Korea to develop in very much the same way as China itself did in the 1970s and 80s, leading to the rampant and highly successful state-controlled capitalism of recent years.\nThe main architect of this change was Deng Xiaoping. Interestingly, his only formal official position for years was his control over the military committee of China's Communist Party: not very different from the most important of the young Kim Jong-un's new jobs.\nChina clearly wants reform in North Korea. There have been various signs of its alarm over North Korea's unpredictable military policy.\nThe thought that its economy might simply implode, perhaps unleashing a wave of millions of refugees across North Korea's borders, is deeply disturbing to the Chinese leadership.\nAnd so the signs are that China is prodding North Korea down the path it took itself: control of the military by the Communist Party, and a gradual opening up of the economy to market forces.\nTo a very small extent, this already seems to be happening. People are being allowed to sell their produce openly in the streets, and at night the police no longer break up the illegal markets held in the darkened streets, as they did until recently.\nIt may not sound much, but it is very much the way the process began in China, a little over 30 years ago.\nAnd in the odd politics of the Kim family, distinctly absurd to Western eyes, it may make sense to pass over Kim Jong-il's relatives and his two elder sons and hand on the succession to his youngest, who was educated in Switzerland.\nThis gives him first-hand experience of life in a market economy;  something no other close member of the clan can boast.\nIf fate is kind to Kim Jong-il, he will have some years yet to ease his son into the job of running the country.\nIf not, then things could well become much more worrying.\nAnd it would probably not be difficult to find a number of political figures who might feel they had a better right to run the country than a little known ex-schoolboy from Switzerland with an interest in basketball.", "summary": "North Korea has begun the process of political succession in the same idiosyncratic manner it has developed over the decades.", "id": "11432894"}
{"document": "What is the row about?\nHindus and Muslims have been at loggerheads for more than a century over the Babri mosque in Ayodhya, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\nHindus claim the mosque was the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram, and that it was built after the destruction of a Hindu temple by a Muslim invader in the 16th Century.\nMuslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949, when some people placed the idols of Ram under the cover of darkness in the mosque. The worship of the idols began soon after.\nOver the next four decades, Hindu and Muslim groups went to court over the control of the site and the right to offer prayers there.\nThe dispute erupted in 1992 when a Hindu mob destroyed the mosque, and nearly 2,000 people were killed in subsequent religious riots across the country.\nWhat do the courts say about the row?\nAllahabad High Court's ruling in September 2010 addressed three questions. It said that the disputed spot was Ram's birthplace, that the mosque was built after the demolition of a temple and that it was not built in accordance with the tenets of Islam.\nFollowing the decision, Hindus hope to see a temple built on the site, while Muslims are still demanding the reconstruction of the mosque.\nIn 2011 the Supreme Court suspended the ruling after Hindu and Muslim groups appealed against the 2010 verdict.\nThe case has already languished in India's famously sluggish legal system for so long that most of the original petitioners have died.\nWho was awarded what?\nThe court ruled in an 8,500-page judgement that two-thirds of the disputed site should be allocated to Hindu groups, with the remainder to Muslims.\nFor the first time in a judicial ruling, it said that the disputed site was the birthplace of the Hindu god.\nThe court ordered that the current arrangement at Ayodhya - which is currently the site of a makeshift Hindu temple - should be \"maintained as the status quo\" for three months to allow time for any appeals against the judgement.\nHow did the judges rule on the conflicting claims?\nThe court ruled that the disputed site is the birth place of Lord Ram, who is \"both a juristic person and a deity\".\nThe two Hindu judges on the three-judge panel said that the building constructed by the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India, Babur, was not a mosque because it was built \"against the tenets of Islam\" on the site of a demolished Hindu temple.\nHowever the Muslim judge in the case dissented from this view, arguing that no temple had been destroyed and that the mosque was built on ruins.\nThe two Hindu judges also agreed that the Ayodhya site was found by the Archaeological Survey of India originally to have been \"a massive Hindu religious structure\" and that Hindus had been worshipping there as a \"sacred place of pilgrimage... since time immemorial\".\nIt also ruled that Hindu idols were placed in the disputed structure in 1949 - a point which Muslims argue is important because that act, they say, triggered much of the tension over Ayodhya that remains today.\nWhen did Hindu-Muslim tensions last escalate?\nMore than 50 people died in February 2002 when a train carrying Hindu activists returning to Gujarat from Ayodhya was set alight, allegedly by a Muslim mob.\nAt least 1,000 people - mainly Muslims - died in the violence in the state that erupted afterwards. Other estimates say the death toll was at least double that.\nHave religious tensions eased in India in recent years?\nYes. It is now not as easy to mobilise young people under the banner of religion as it was in the early 1990s.\nIndia's economic boom has changed priorities, and development is now the key issue.

{"document": "His 16 years in office made him the longest-serving German chancellor since Bismarck and he was once described as the greatest European leader in the second half of the 20th Century.\nHe was a passionate supporter of greater European integration and was one of the main architects of the Maastricht Treaty.\nYet the end of his career was marred by economic problems in the old East Germany and a financial scandal within his own CDU party.\nHelmut Josef Michael Kohl was born on 3 April 1930 into a conservative, Catholic family,\nHis political outlook was shaped by his experiences in his hometown of Ludwigshafen in the Rhineland during World War Two.\nBecause of its huge chemical works, the town was heavily bombed and, at the age of 12, the young Helmut found himself helping to recover the charred bodies of his neighbours from the rubble. What he once described as \"the blessing of a late birth\" freed him from any taints of Nazism.\nAfter studying politics and law at Heidelberg University, Kohl entered politics in the German federal system where, in the Rhineland Palatinate, he rose to become the youngest Land [federal state] minister-president at the age of 39.\nHe built up a large network of political allies and forced through important changes, among them the law that outlawed denominational schools unless 80% of the parents approved.\nThree years later, Kohl became national chairman of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the dominant post-war West German political party.\nHe was the CDU's candidate for chancellor in the 1976 election, but was defeated by the Social Democrat/Free Democrat coalition of Helmut Schmidt.\nFour years later, Kohl looked on as another CDU candidate, and great rival, the Bavarian Prime Minister Franz Josef Strauss, also went down to defeat by Schmidt.\nA bear of a man, Kohl was often ridiculed for his love of food - one nickname being \"Birne\" or pear - and for his often clumsy provincial manner. Beyond this, Kohl's critics relentlessly mocked him for what they said was his lacklustre oratory and apparent lack of vision.\nBut many underestimated his ability to wield power, which he managed through a complex, but highly effective, network of patronage and political cronies.\nIn 1982, after the Free Democrats had left the ruling coalition, he took over as chancellor from Helmut Schmidt, and would go on to win the next four general elections, staying in power for 16 years.\nThe 1980s witnessed a golden age of German economic and political power. Together with his closest ally, France's President Mitterrand, Kohl shaped the federal ideal of the European Union and laid the groundwork for the creation of the single currency.\nIn 1987 there was a groundbreaking visit to West Germany by the East German leader, Erich Honecker. It was part of Kohl's policy of detente with the East, something his party had firmly rejected just 20 years before.\nTwo years later, the Berlin Wall came down and Kohl began the negotiations that would lead to reunification.\nHaving realised that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts to reform communism would fail, Kohl persuaded him to withdraw from East Germany, while allowing a reunited Germany to remain a member of Nato.\nThe 350,000 Soviet troops based in the East were sent home, the costs borne by the West German government. On 3 October 1990, East Germany ceased to exist with its five historical states becoming part of the new federal republic.\nKohl's drive for reunification was not welcomed by everyone, with  Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir publicly opposing it.  While broadly welcomed by the West, there were concerns, notably in Britain and Poland, that a strong unified Germany would come to dominate the continent.\nBut Kohl was able to convince Gorbachev and US President George HW Bush that a united Germany would not destabilise or threaten Europe in the way Hitler's Germany had done.\n\"George Bush was for me the most important ally on the road to German unity,\" he said.\nKohl also made the political decision to grant East Germans immediate economic parity, even though his central bankers told him of the massive economic dislocation this would incur. They predicted correctly that Germany's economy would be badly affected for a decade.\nEven so, Helmut Kohl had pulled off a remarkable political coup that might not have occurred had he dithered. But the huge economic repercussions of reunification robbed him of some of the popularity he might have expected, particularly in the former East where, during one visit, he was pelted with eggs.\nUnder his rule, the East suffered an economic collapse, with high rates of poverty and unemployment the norm. And the costs of reunification led to an economic downturn throughout Germany.\nHe was slow to respond when neo-Nazis burned down the homes of immigrant Turkish families and hostels for refugees from Africa. He sometimes pushed aside the concerns of smaller nations to the east, like the Czechs and the Poles.\nAnd he had a strained relationship with the UK and other countries that did not share his vision of a federal Europe.\nChief among Kohl's perceived antagonists was Margaret Thatcher. In a revealing volume of autobiography, published in 2005, he alleged that her anger boiled over in December 1989 after she was obliged to sign a communique supporting German reunification.\n\"I will never forget Margaret Thatcher's angry observation: 'We have beaten the Germans twice. Now they're back.'\"\nAfter he lost power in elections in 1998, it was revealed that Kohl had accepted, for his party, millions of dollars of secret political donations.\nDespite refusing to name the donors, and despite his destroying much potentially incriminating evidence before he left the chancellery, he was spared possible corruption charges out of respect for his years of leadership.\nBut his reputation was badly damaged.

{"document": "It puts new, lower limits on the size of each country's nuclear arsenal, and updates the verification mechanism.\nThere are limits on warheads and on launchers, which must be implemented within seven years of the treaty's entry into force.\nWarheads: Under the New Start treaty each side is allowed a maximum of 1,550 warheads. This is about 30% lower than the figure of 2,200 that each side was meant to reach by 2012 under the Start treaty (as revised in the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty).\nLaunchers: Each country is allowed, in total, no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear arms. Another 100 are allowed if they are not operationally deployed - for example, missiles removed from a sub undergoing a long-term overhaul.\nThe new limit on delivery systems is less than half the ceiling of 1,600 specified in the original Start treaty.\nNot as dramatic as they might appear. The rules for counting warheads contain a big loophole. While each warhead on a ballistic missile is counted as one warhead, a heavy bomber is counted as carrying \"one warhead\" even though it may carry (in the case of a US B-52) up to 20 of them.\nAccording to the Arms Control Association, a pro-disarmament pressure group, the US could theoretically meet the new limits by cutting just 100 warheads, while Russia would only need to cut 190.\nIn addition, the agreed ceilings refer to deployed warheads, not to warheads in storage. A warhead could, in theory, be put into storage, and then redeployed when needed.\nThe cuts in launchers are also, in practice, not all that challenging. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimates that Russia currently has 566 - well under the permitted ceiling of 700. It estimates that the US has 798, necessitating a cut of about 12%.\nSupporters of the deal say that while it does not make big cuts, it is a useful confidence-building measure, which could pave the way for further nuclear deals with Russia.\nThey say it also signals to the rest of the world that the US and Russia are not ignoring their commitment under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to progressively disarm.\nThe important difference, according to the Arms Control Association, is that each side will now be able to carry out on-site inspections to verify how many warheads a missile is carrying. Together with satellite imagery, this should give an accurate picture of the other country's nuclear strength. Some other forms of verification will cease.\nYes, it says that both sides can engage in \"limited\" missile defence. Russia has warned that it will withdraw from the treaty if a future US missile defence shield weakens its nuclear deterrent.\nThe US Senate ratified it on 22 December, after much delay, so now all it needs is Russia's final approval.

But when the show moved to London, most of the Everyman's company moved with it, leaving a big gap back in Liverpool.\nA young Jonathan Pryce was charged with assembling a new acting company, and signed up Julie Walters, Bill Nighy, Matthew Kelly and Nicholas le Provost to appear in The Taming of the Shrew that October.\nThat play would also have featured Pete Postlethwaite as Petruchio. But he had just accepted another job at the Playhouse, the Everyman's city rival.\nHe came on board for the next production, however, for a period that saw the Everyman act as a springboard for the careers of some of Britain's most popular and acclaimed actors.\nThe story of the Everyman's class of '74 has come to the fore again, but is tinged with sadness following Postlethwaite's death.\nHis conviction and charisma made a big impression on his fellow cast members.\n\"Peter was at the centre of that amazing ensemble in Liverpool in the early 70s,\" recalls Walters. \"I was in a production of Brecht's Coriolanus with him and I have never ever seen anybody act like that.\n\"It was just absolutely extraordinary. Talk about being enthralled - the audience were completely terrified part of the time.\n\"I've never seen anything like that before or since. When he came off stage, his mother said to him: 'Oh Peter, you'll go round the bend if you carry on like that.'\"\nPryce recalls Postlethwaite as an \"enormously likeable, hugely talented, compassionate, political man\".\n\"You couldn't help but like him, and audiences loved him. And he had a great sense of fun about him,\" he says.\nPryce puts the theatre's golden spell down to its former artistic director Alan Dossor, who was determined to reflect real life in the region and to draw the city's population in.\nThat included a highly political agenda, with Dossor commissioning plays about local issues and scandals.\n\"The idea was to tackle the political establishment,\" Pryce recalls. \"There were lots of targets at the time, and it was felt that it was possible to do things at a local level.\"\nDossor's determination to put real voices on stage was coupled with an attempt to nurture the talent of his performers.\n\"People were taken care of,\" says Pryce, who went on to win two Laurence Olivier Awards in the West End as an actor and a pair of Tony Awards on Broadway.\n\"It was a family. You look back on it and think, yes, it was an extraordinary time. For a lot of us, it formed the way we approached our work.\"\nThere was an emphasis on the whole cast working together to tell the story of a play, rather than a play being a vehicle for star performers, and the methods helped the actors become \"fearless\" on stage, Pryce adds.\n\"You were being judged by a tough audience, but you weren't being judged by the people you were working with.\"\nDossor, speaking to some of his former proteges in BBC Radio 4's documentary The Reunion, broadcast in 2004, said: \"The one thing I wanted all of you to have when you left was the ability to not be wobbled by bad decisions, so that you could survive.\"\nThe gang stayed together for productions including children's show The Pig and the Junkle, the bawdy comedy Funny Peculiar and Willy Russell's Breezeblock Park.\nThe close-knit group spent hours upon hours in each other's company - if not on stage at the theatre, then putting on shows in local pubs and clubs, drinking in the theatre bar or in the houses they shared.\nIt was inevitable that relationships formed off stage - Walters got together with Postlethwaite, and Pryce's future wife, Kate Fahy, was also a member of the company.\n\"The focal point of the theatre was the bar,\" Pryce recalls.\n\"You were in the building more or less all day. It was a lot of fun. We lived in the same boarding houses. You'd have a room or a flat in one of the houses and we all lived together and socialised.\n\"Those relationships have lasted 30-odd years.\"", "summary": "Pete Postlethwaite, who died last week, was part of a remarkable group of young actors and writers who started their careers at the Liverpool Everyman theatre in the 1970s, alongside Julie Walters, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce and Willy Russell.", "id": "12161591"}

{"document": "Around 30 Peruvian and Brazilian rally car drivers did exactly that to mark a new stretch of a road that connects their nations.\nThe two countries have historically had their figurative backs to one another with their shared border running through the Amazon rainforest, but are now trying to forge stronger links.\nSetting off from Nazca, in Peru's coastal desert on 19 January, the drivers traversed the Andes cordillera to Cusco, rising to 4,725m (15,500ft) above sea level.\nThey then descended into the Amazon rainforest of Madre de Dios, the frontier region that borders Brazil and Bolivia.\nThe race over some 2,200km (1,367 miles) involved a brief break to cross a river by ferry as a key bridge is still not finished. Competitors then continued on to Inapari on the border, reached first by Peruvian professional rally car driver Nicolas Fuchs.\nVehicle registration problems meant most of the drivers could not cross into Brazil to complete the last 200km or so to Rio Branco, capital of Acre state.\nBureaucratic problems aside, the dramatic route was the main challenge.\n\"The road doesn't just have curves, it has big drops, places where if you make a mistake, you die,\" said Luiz Facco, a Brazilian driver who raced alongside wife and co-driver Cristina, told the BBC in Cusco's main square.\nApart from being a symbol of South American integration, the road links will also boost - potentially hugely - trade with Asia.\nChina has already replaced the US as Brazil's number one trading partner. With this road, Brazil will eventually have paved access to five Pacific-facing Peruvian ports.\nFor its part, Peru is strategically sandwiched between two of the world's largest emerging economies - China to the west and Brazil, to the east.\n\"This road is a dream,\" says Miguel Vega, president of the Peru-Brazil Chamber of Commerce.\n\"As we say in football, the midfield dominates the game. This road will put Peru in the midfield between Asia and South America.\"\nBut the road is also proving to be an environmentalists' nightmare.\n\"Asphalting the road itself doesn't do any real harm,\" says Rob Williams, Peru research co-ordinator for the Frankfurt Zoological Society.\n\"It's the secondary roads which come off the main road in a fishbone pattern which do the damage. These continue to fragment the Amazon until the whole strip along the Interoceanic highway is deforested.\"\nWidely viewed by scientists as the most bio-diverse corner of the Amazon rainforest, Madre de Dios is bisected by the road.\nWhere the Andes meet the Amazon, the Interoceanic highway passes directly through the town of Quince Mil. In its main square is a statue of an old man panning for gold.\n\"Everyone knows how to pan for gold here but nowadays miners are coming with heavy machinery and mercury,\" says Quince Mil resident Ozwaldo Escobar.\n\"They are polluting our water supply, killing the fish and destroying the forest.\n\"There's little we can do because they bribe the police and the local authorities,\" he alleges.\nA young man, known just as Renzo, told the BBC he gets weekly visits from his Lima-based gold buyer, who pays 108 Peruvian soles ($38.97) per gram for the precious metal.\nDriving eastward deeper into the Amazon lowlands, a sea of blue tarpaulin springs up from the roadside. It is a tent city but it is bustling with commerce.\nFood and other supplies are sold out of the back of passing lorries and motorcycle workshops do a roaring trade amid the constant thrum of petrol-fuelled generators.\nSome of these gold rush settlements are so new they are known simply as kilometre 108 and 115, marking their distance from Cusco.\nFrom the edge of the road they cut into the jungle, spreading out into dozens of routes to gold mines. Seen from the air whole patches of rainforest are pocked by stagnant mercury-polluted pools or turned into desert.\nAt junctures along the highway, government placards show pictures of how awful the road once was and how it looks now, with messages like: Before: Devastation; Now: Optimism.\nBut the road is not only set to boost trade, but also migration.\nMore than 200 people a day are coming from the Andes to the Amazon, swelling an estimated 30,000 people living from illicit gold mining, says Juan Carlos Navarro of Caritas, a Roman Catholic charity based in Puerto Maldonado, the regional capital of Madre de Dios.\n\"The government institutions are simply too weak to control it,\" said Mr Navarro. The local authorities were petitioning the central government to declare an environmental state of emergency in the region, he added.\n\"More than development, the road has brought us problems,\" says Luis Aguirre, just a month into his new job as governor of Madre de Dios.\n\"It was supposed to bring progress but instead it's brought us more crime, more drug-addiction, more deforestation, more ecological destruction and more unchecked migration.\"\nIt seems a pessimistic assessment at odds with the triumphant tone of Peruvian President Alan Garcia. He has called the five years spent building the 2,589km-long road as man's triumph over nature and distance.\nOn its final leg, the rally car race speeds through the sleepy border town of Inapari where excited boys and their fathers line the road, mobile phone cameras poised to snap a picture.\nSuleyde Ochoa left Inapari 23 years ago. Now married to an Iranian and with two daughters, she has  returned to set up a roadside restaurant.\n\"Before the road was so bad it would take a week just to get to Puerto Maldonado,\" she told the BBC.

That decision will be final.\"\nShe added the government was about to launch a consultation on closing down \"four existing loopholes\" in the registration system, including making it compulsory for offenders to notify the police if they intended to travel abroad for even one day, as opposed to the current three days or more.\nBBC political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said the ruling meant ministers were now \"committed to introducing a review process\".\n\"They were due to bring proposals forward around now to amend the Sexual Offences Act 2003 but government sources have told the BBC an appeal system won't be introduced to Parliament until the spring,\" he said.\nHe added the move was likely to infuriate backbenchers on both sides of the Commons who last week registered their disapproval over plans to give prisoners the vote in elections following legal decisions based on human rights laws.\nMark Williams-Thomas, a former police officer who worked in child protection, is concerned about the decision - particularly in relation to child sex offenders.\n\"These people are like leopards, they don't change their spots,\" he said.\n\"What we will end up with is potentially a very dangerous situation where someone has committed offences in the past and be able to say they haven't committed any new offences and therefore don't present a risk.\n\"But they are a risk in the same way as an alcoholic is always an alcoholic.\"", "summary": "Thousands of sex offenders in England and Wales are set to be given the right to appeal against having to register with the police for life.", "id": "12476979"}

{"document": "Sufism or Islamic mysticism was once suppressed by the Taliban, but the sect is recovering its place in the country and its millions of followers are once more emerging from the shadows.\nSufis have considerable influence in both rural and urban settings - they are an effective popular force to bring change into society - and people consider them as disinterested mediators in disputes.\n''The influence of Sufis will be very significant in bringing peace and tranquillity,'' says Sayed Mahmood Gailani, a Sufi master.\n''There are a few people with Sufi backgrounds who are involved in the peace process. But there hasn't been any concerted effort to give the Sufis a systematic and prominent role in it.''\nSufism in Afghanistan is considered an integral part of Islam. People in general respect Sufis for their learning and believe they possess \"karamat\" - a miraculous spiritual power that enables Sufi masters to perform acts of generosity and bestow blessings.\nZiyarats - Sufi shrines - are popular pilgrimage sites all over the country.\nIn addition to Afghanistan, Sufi orders have millions of followers in both Pakistan and India too.\nThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the following armed resistance by the mujahideen resulted in the arrival of thousands of Middle Eastern fighters and the introduction of foreign ideologies including Wahabism.\nWahabism insists on a literal interpretation of Islam and sees Sufism and its ideas as anathema. This created tension between Sufis and Ulamas (religious scholars) in some parts of the country.\nBut it was during the Taliban's rule (1996-2001) when many Sufis were driven underground.\nA number were initially part of the Taliban movement but gradually people influenced by the Wahabi ideology became more prominent. Sufis were silenced.\nSome Sufis, especially members of the Chishtiyya Sufi Order which considers music to be an effective route to reach Allah, were prosecuted.\n\"The Taliban invaded Sufi gatherings, humiliated and beat up many of them and their musical instruments were smashed,'' said Afghan Culture Minister Sayed Makhdoom Rahin, who has a Sufi background.\n''Sufis are free to hold their ceremonies once again with the same old exuberance denied to them by the Taliban.''\nGiven the respect and influence Sufis enjoy among the local population, their involvement at the grass roots level could help the peace process in war-torn Afghanistan.\nAlthough Taliban members come from various backgrounds, some have great respect for Sufis and are even followers of Sufism.\n\"Influential and knowledgeable Sufis can persuade a large number of Taliban to lay down their arms and can also provide guarantees to the Taliban about their safety and peaceful future,'' a Sufi leader, Ahmad Shah Maududi, said.\n''But we need to be careful and vigilant because many so-called Sufis have exploited and fooled ordinary people in the garb of Sufism.''\nSufism has been part of Afghanistan almost as long as Islam itself - more than 1,300 years. Afghanistan is commonly called \"the home of Sufi saints\". The mystics have been an integral part of the life of the people for centuries.\nThe word Sufism is derived from \"suf\", the Arabic wood for wool, and refers to woollen robes worn by early ascetics.\nSufis seek to achieve communion with God during mystic moments of union brought about by various methods, including meditation, Zikr (reciting the names of God and other sacred phrases), dancing, hymn singing, music and physical gyrations.\nSufis maintain that human beings are creatures of Allah and they should be served and respected.\n''Tolerance, kindness and love to all and malice towards none are the virtues of Sufis,'' says Maulana Obaidullah Nahrkarizi, a prominent Afghan Sufi master from Kandahar province.\n''This is the solution to the nation's trauma and battle of the past 30 years''.\nMany Afghan cities are among the most important centres of Sufism. Herat is called \"the soil of Sufi saints\" while Ghazni is known as \"the place of Sufi saints\".\nSome of the greatest Sufi sages of the Muslim world originated from Afghanistan. They refined their insights in the country's lush plains and hidden valleys - and spread their message of peace and love to other parts of the world.\nThe intensely personal poetry of Sufis has been expressed in Dari, Persian and Pashto, the main languages spoken in Afghanistan.\nThere are several prominent Sufis  in contemporary Afghanistan including Ali Hujwiri, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin Balkhi Rumi - founder of the famous Mawlawiya (the Order of Whirling Dervishes).\nAnother famous Sufi is Pir Roshan, the founder of the Roshaniya Sufi Order, now known as Arzan Shahi - which has a big following in India.\nThree Sufi orders are prominent in Afghanistan today - Naqshbandiya founded in Bokhara (Uzbekistan), Qadiriya founded in Baghdad and Chishtiya originated at Chisht-e-Sharif in the western province of Herat.\nTheir continued growth is arguably a major bonus in Afghanistan's continuing search for peace.", "summary": "As the Afghan government and its international allies intensify efforts to bring the conflict to an end, the role and influence of mystics is being sought to help bring the Taliban into talks on a political solution.", "id": "12539409"}

His mother neglected him and he was raised by foster parents in the Gorbals, Glasgow's toughest slum.\nAfter a spree of petty crime as a teenager the courts sent him to Manchester to live with his mother and her new husband, Patrick Brady.\nHe assumed his stepfather's name, continued his criminal activities and developed into a fully-fledged teenage alcoholic.\nBy now he had acquired new interests, building up a library of books on Nazi Germany, sadism and sexual perversion.\nHe first met Hindley when she worked as a secretary at the company where they were both employed.\nFor Hindley it was love at first sight. Brady impressed her by reading Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf in the original German.\nAs their relationship developed, they began taking obscene photographs of each other before turning their attention to kidnapping, child molestation and murder.\nBetween July 1963 and December 1964, 16-year-old Pauline Reade, 12-year-old John Kilbride and Keith Bennett, also 12, were reported missing, all in the Manchester area.\nAnother victim - Lesley Ann Downey, 10 - disappeared on 26 December 1964.\nAuthorities were baffled by what they referred to as the \"unrelated\" cases, and were left without a single piece of solid evidence.\nIn the meantime, Brady and Hindley were intent on a campaign to corrupt Hindley's brother-in-law, David Smith, and recruit him into their circle.\nA petty criminal with convictions of his own, Smith was amused when the conversation turned to murder; he questioned Brady's ability to follow it through.\nOn 6 October 1965, Brady offered a practical demonstration with Edward Evans, a homosexual teenager, striking him 14 times with a hatchet before strangling him.\nHorrified, Smith phoned the police the next morning, directing them to Brady's address.\nThe officers caught Brady and Hindley at home, retrieving a fresh corpse from the bedroom, along with the bloody hatchet and Brady's library of volumes on perversion and sadism.\nA 12-year-old neighbour recalled several trips she had made with the couple to Saddleworth Moor, and the police launched a search which uncovered the body of Leslie Ann Downey on 16 October.\nFour days later, another search of Brady's flat turned up two left luggage tickets for Manchester Central Station, leading police to a pair of hidden suitcases.\nInside, they found nude photographs of the girl, along with tape recordings of her final tortured moments, pleading for her life as she was sexually abused.\nA series of seemingly innocent snapshots depicted portions of Saddleworth Moor, and detectives paid another visit to the desolate region on 21 October, unearthing the body of John Kilbride.\nPolice announced they were opening their files on eight people who had disappeared over the previous four years, but no new charges had been added by the time the couple went on trial.\nJurors were stunned by the Downey tape, and by Brady's bland description of the recording as \"unusual\".\nOn 6 May 1966, both defendants were convicted of killing Edward Evans and Leslie Ann Downey. Brady was also found guilty of murdering John Kilbride, while Hindley was convicted as an accessory after the fact.\nBrady was sentenced to concurrent life terms on each count, while Hindley received two life terms plus seven years in the Kilbride case.\nNineteen years later, in November 1985, Brady was transferred from prison to a maximum-security hospital after being diagnosed a psychopath.\nThere, in an interview with newspaper reporters, he confessed to the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett.\nAnother year passed before searchers returned to the moors, with Hindley joining them for an abortive outing in December 1986, and Brady doing the same in 1987.\nThe remains of Pauline Reade were uncovered on 30 June 1987, nearly a quarter of a century after her disappearance.\nIt took pathologists a month to decide she had been sexually assaulted, her throat slashed from behind.\nIn August 1987, Brady posted a letter to the BBC containing sketchy information on five \"new\" murders he said he had committed.\nFive months later the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that, in the public interest, there would be no prosecution of the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett.\nBrady accepted from the start that he would never be released, unlike Hindley who, in trying to secure parole, claimed Brady had forced her into killing by abusing and torturing her into submission.\nBut Brady reacted to her allegation by claiming: \"For 20 years I continued to ratify the cover I had given her at the trial whilst, in contrast, she systematically began to fabricate upon it to my detriment.\"\nMyra Hindley died in 2002. Ian Brady, who had been on hunger strike, and force-fed daily, declared he would rather die quickly than rot slowly in jail.\nHis attempts to force the authorities to let him starve himself to death failed. In March 2000 a judge described his hunger strike as part of his \"obsessive need to exercise control\".\nA year later Brady's book - The Gates of Janus, an analysis of serial murders - was released by an American firm, Feral House. The decision to publish caused an outcry in the British press and resulted in hate mail being sent to the publisher, Adam Parfrey.\nIn 2012 Brady asked to be returned to prison so he could starve himself to death without the force-feeding permitted in mental institutions.\nA tribunal ruled it was appropriate that he continue to be treated in a mental hospital.\nIn the same year Keith Bennett's mother, Winnie Johnson, who had fought for four decades to have the two killers prosecuted for her son's murder, died of cancer. Her overriding wish, to find Keith's remains and give him a Christian burial, was never fulfilled.\nJohn Kilbride's brother Danny, who had campaigned against any suggestion the two should ever be released, died a year earlier.\nChris Cowley, a forensic psychologist who had spent six years in dialogues with Brady, had earlier concluded he was a sociopath with few redeeming features, showing no compassion or feeling for anyone other than himself.\n\"His only thought for the victims or their families is what he can get out of it,\" Dr Cowley told the Sunday Telegraph in 2011. \"He would kill again without a thought for anyone who gets in his way.\"", "summary": "Few killers achieved the notoriety or attracted as much public loathing as the so-called \"Moors Murderer\", Ian Brady, who has died at the age of 79.", "id": "12735333"}
