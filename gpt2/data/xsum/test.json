{"document": "The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.\nDr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. \"Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,\" he was once quoted as saying.\nAnd he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.\nBut his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.\nAfter the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.\nScientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.\nBorn in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.\nAs an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.\nThis inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.\n\"Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,\" he said.\nDuring his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.\nBut the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.\nThen came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.\nHe switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.\nHis success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work \"any monkey\" could do.\nThe criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.\nAnd, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.\nHis greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.\nBoth efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.\nNevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.\nIn 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.\nBut he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.\nThe project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.\nThe synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.\n\"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes.\n\"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"", "summary": "\"Maverick\" is a word that seems to follow Craig Venter around.", "id": "10138849"}

All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us.\n\"There was constant bombing and shellfire.  We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep.\"\nIn the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England.\n\"As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves.

He had lost an army.\"\nThe German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation.\nMy father describes how on the morning of 1 June, he witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a \"lack of moral fibre\".\n\"We were embarking more stores and ammunition back in Dover. An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others.\n\"Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged. Anybody feeling the stress of the last week was told to leave the ship and assemble on the dockside in preparation for going to hospital.\n\"About 20 men left the ship and I can still see their grins as they trooped over the gangway. The majority were malingerers but in fairness, the prospect of that final trip was frightening as the Germans were almost on the French beaches.\"\nThe captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain.\n\"We both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so we remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return.\"\nTo my father's dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo.\n\"This was the greatest blow which sometimes I feel to this day,\" he says, on the eve of his 98th birthday.", "summary": "BBC world affairs correspondent Peter Biles has been talking to his father, Harold, about his recollections of the Dunkirk evacuation.", "id": "10169745"}

{"document": "Giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller said the action had radicalised \"a few among a generation\".\nAs a result, she said she was not \"surprised\" that UK nationals were involved in the 7/7 bombings in London.\nShe said she believed the intelligence on Iraq's threat was not \"substantial enough\" to justify the action.\nBaroness Manningham-Buller said she had advised officials a year before the war that the threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited\", and she believed that assessment had \"turned out to be the right judgement\".\nDescribing the intelligence on Iraq's weapons threat as \"fragmentary\", she said: \"If you are going to go to war, you need to have a pretty high threshold to decide on that.\"\nIn a previously secret document from 2002, Baroness Manningham-Buller wrote to the Home Office saying: \"We assess that Saddam is only likely to order terrorist attacks if he perceives that the survival of his regime is threatened.\"\nThe Chilcot inquiry is continuing to hear evidence about decisions taken in the build-up to the invasion and its aftermath.\nBaroness Manningham-Buller, head of the domestic intelligence service between 2002 and 2007, said the terrorist threat to the UK from al-Qaeda and other groups \"pre-dated\" the Iraq invasion and also the 9/11 attacks in the US.\nHowever, she said the UK's participation in the March 2003 military action \"undoubtedly increased\" the level of terrorist threat.\nBy Peter BilesBBC correspondent at the inquiry\nThe former head of MI5 chose her words very carefully.\nBaroness Manningham-Buller was giving her evidence in public, although 35 witnesses have previously testified to the Iraq inquiry behind closed doors in order to protect national security or international relations.\nKey to her evidence was the release of the declassified assessment which she wrote in March 2002, a year before the invasion of Iraq.\nThis played down the direct threat to the UK from Saddam Hussein's regime, and its possible links to al-Qaeda.\nAs was expected, the focus of her evidence remained on the implications of the 2003 invasion for Britain, rather than the actual decision to go to war.\nGiven the gravity of the situation, with 16 suspected terrorism plots uncovered in the UK between 2001 and 2008, it may be a surprise to some that she did not have direct conversations with Tony Blair during her time as head of MI5.\nA year after the invasion, she said MI5 was \"swamped\" by leads about terrorist threats to the UK.\n\"Our involvement in Iraq, for want of a better word, radicalised a whole generation of young people, some of them British citizens who saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam,\" she said, before immediately correcting herself by adding \"not a whole generation, a few among a generation\".\nThe ex-MI5 chief said she shared her concerns that the Iraq invasion would increase the UK's exposure to terrorism with the then home secretary David Blunkett, but did not \"recall\" discussing the matter with Prime Minister Tony Blair.\nMI5 did not \"foresee the degree to which British citizens would become involved\" in terrorist activity after 2004, she admitted.\n\"What Iraq did was produce fresh impetus on people prepared to engage in terrorism,\" she said, adding that she could produce evidence to back this up.\n\"The Iraq war heightened the extremist view that the West was trying to bring down Islam. We gave Bin Laden his jihad.\"\nLady Manningham-Buller said MI5 was given a budget increase after 9/11 and again in 2002 but the agency still needed far greater resources as a result of the Iraq invasion.\n\"By 2003 I found it necessary to ask the prime minister for a doubling of our budget,\" she said. \"This is unheard of, certainly unheard of today, but he and the Treasury and the chancellor accepted that, because I was able to demonstrate the scale of the problem that we were confronted by.\"\nBaroness Manningham-Buller was part of the government's Joint Intelligence Committee before the war, which drew up the controversial dossier on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction in September 2002. The dossier stated the weapons could be activated with 45 minutes of an order to do so.\nAsked about the dossier, she said she had very limited involvement in its compilation but it was clear, with hindsight, that there was an \"over-reliance\" on certain intelligence.\nShe added: \"We were asked to put in some low-grade, small intelligence into it and we refused because we did not think that it was reliable.\"\nShe said MI5's responsibility was to collect and analyse intelligence and to \"act on it where necessary\" to mitigate terrorist threats, but stressed it was not her job \"to fill in gaps\" in the intelligence.\nA year before the war, the former MI5 chief advised Home Office officials that the direct threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited and containable\".\nIn a newly declassified document, published by the inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller told the senior civil servant at the Home Office in March 2002 that there was no evidence that Iraq had any involvement in the 9/11 attacks.\nWhile there were reports of links between the regime of Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, there was no intelligence to suggest meaningful co-operation between the two.\nIn that letter, she said the possibility Iraq might use terrorist tactics to defend its own territory in the event of an invasion could not be ruled out.\nBut she stressed Iraqi agents did not have \"much capability\" to carry out UK attacks, adding her view of this never changed.\nIn his evidence in January, Tony Blair described Saddam Hussein as a \"monster\" and said the world was a safer place with him no longer in control of Iraq.", "summary": "The invasion of Iraq \"substantially\" increased the terrorist threat to the UK, the former head of MI5 has said.", "id": "10693001"}

{"document": "Next month, archaeologists will begin work off the coast of Kenya to identify a wreck believed to have belonged to the man some historians believe inspired the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor.\nChinese archaeologists, who arrived in the African country this week, are hoping that the shipwreck could provide evidence of the first contact between China and east Africa.\nSetting sail more than 600 years ago, Zheng's armada made seven epic voyages, reaching south-east Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\nSome say he even made it to America - several decades before the celebrated European explorer Christopher Columbus - although this has been widely disputed by historians.\nZheng, known as the Three-Jewel Eunuch Admiral, carried gifts from the Chinese emperor aboard his \"treasure ship\", which groaned with valuable cargo including gold, porcelain and silks.\nThese were exchanged along the established Arab trade routes for ivory, myrrh and even China's first giraffe, promoting recognition of the new Ming dynasty.\nBut within years of his death, Zheng appeared to fade from public consciousness, and for centuries his legend was overlooked as China turned its back on the world and entered a long period of isolation.\nNow Zheng is enjoying a resurgence - and there appears to be more than historical curiosity behind his revival.\nThe sunken ship is believed to have been part of Zheng's armada, which reached the coastal town of Malindi in 1418.\nThe Chinese seem confident they will find the wreck near the Lamu archipelago, where pieces of Ming-era ceramics have already surfaced.\nThe Chinese government is investing \u00c2\u00a32m ($3m) in the three-year joint project, which Kenya says it hopes will throw up important findings about early relations between China and Africa.\nAnalysts say this ties in well with China's diplomatic overtures to African nations, as it goes about securing natural resources and political influence.\nZheng He - also known as Cheng Ho - is being hailed anew as a national hero; invoked by the Communist Party as a pioneer of China's \"open-door\" policies that have once again made China a world power.\n\"The rise of China has induced a lot of fear,\" says Geoff Wade of the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore.\n\"Zheng is being portrayed as a symbol of China's openness to the world, as an envoy of its peace and friendship - these two words keep cropping up in virtually every reference to Zheng He out of China,\" says Prof Wade.\nIn talks with the head of Asean, a grouping of South East Asian nations, earlier this year, Chinese state councillor Dai Bingguo, who is a leading figure in foreign policy, said: \"I want to assure you that China is not to be feared.\"\nThe voyages of Zheng He, he said, had brought \"porcelain, silk and tea rather than bloodshed, plundering or colonialism\" - a reference to violent coercive measures used by Western colonisers.\n\"To this day, Zheng He is still remembered as an envoy of friendship and peace,\" Mr Dai said.\nZheng He was an admiral in the time of \"empire\", when there were no boundaries, no frontier limits, says China expert Edward Friedman.\n\"The expeditions were real events - Zheng's achievements were extraordinary and a marvel of the time,\" says Prof Friedman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nBut the detail of Zheng's story is open to interpretation, and the version being promoted by the Chinese government ignores history in order to serve foreign policy, he says.\nStatesman Deng Xiaoping, regarded as the chief architect of China's \"opening up\" in the 1980s, said China would never seek hegemony. And President Hu Jintao has said many times that peaceful development is a strategic choice of the Chinese government.\nProf Geoff Wade, a historian who has translated Ming documents relating to Zheng's voyages, disputes the portrayal of a benign adventurer.\nHe says the historical records show the treasure fleets carried sophisticated weaponry and participated in at least three major military actions; in Java, Sumatra and Sri Lanka.\n\"Because there is virtually no critical analysis of these texts even now - history writing is still in the hands of the state - it's very difficult for Chinese people to conceive of the state as being dangerous, expansionist, or offensive in any way to its neighbours.\n\"Chinese nationalism is fed on ignorance of its past relations. The way Zheng He is being represented is part of this.\"\nThe International Zheng He Society in Singapore disputes this \"Western thought\", and says the battles that Zheng was embroiled in were either retaliatory or an effort to rid the high seas of pirates.\n\"These incidents were hardly the nature of true battle but, instead, vividly signify the peaceful diplomacy of Zheng He,\" said spokesman Chen Jian Chin.\nMany layers of myth surround China's ancient mariner. According to Kenyan lore, some of his shipwrecked sailors survived and were allowed to stay and marry local women.\nDNA tests have reportedly shown evidence of Chinese ancestry and a young Kenyan woman, Mwamaka Shirafu, was given a scholarship to study Chinese medicine in China, where she now resides.\n\"She's as much a symbol of international peace and friendship as any historical legacy,\" says Prof Wade.", "summary": "Standing seven feet tall, China's maritime giant Admiral Zheng He led the world's mightiest fleet, with 300 ships and as many as 30,000 troops under his command.", "id": "10767321"}

{"document": "Andal Ampatuan Junior is accused of orchestrating the murder of 57 unarmed civilians, who were ambushed, killed and clumsily buried in a mass grave in the southern province of Maguindanao last November.\nAnother 27 members of his family have also been charged in connection with the killings - five are with him in custody - and they all deny the charges against them.\nBut for many Filipinos, this trial is about much more than establishing the guilt or innocence of one man, or even one family.\nIt's about the huge influence of clans like the Ampatuans, and the culture of impunity surrounding them.\nWhile their involvement in the massacre has yet to be proven, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Ampatuans were - and still are - extremely powerful.\nThe Ampatuans have been in Maguindanao for centuries, and can trace their lineage to a Muslim preacher, Shariff Aguak, who was one of the first people to bring the Islamic faith to the area.\nBut they were not always the dominant force they are today. According to Arnold Esguerra, a history professor at the University of the Philippines in Manila, the surname Ampatuan only started to appear in official documents in the early part of the 20th Century.\nAt that stage they were influential traders, he said - but their social status was definitely beneath that of the \"datus\", the traditional clan rulers.\nThe situation changed in the mid-1970s, when then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, and tried to stamp out the growing Islamic separatist movement by selecting a few people he could trust to administer the province.\nOne of those people was Andal Ampatuan Junior's father, Andal Senior, who is now the undisputed head of the family clan.\nFirst, he became the mayor of Maganoy town - and then, during the presidency of Cory Aquino, he was given the more powerful role of officer-in-charge.\nBut it was under President Gloria Arroyo, who came to power in 2001, when the Ampatuans really came to prominence.\nAndal Senior became governor of Maguindanao, a post he has now held for the maximum three terms.  Then in 2005 his son Zaldy became the governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao - an influential post controlling the five Muslim provinces that have been given a degree of self-rule from central government.\n'Heights of power'\nAndal Junior became mayor of Datu Unsay, a town that bears his nickname, and at the time of the massacre, 10 of Maguindanao's 34 municipalities were run by Ampatuans or their relatives.\nMrs Arroyo's government was good to the Ampatuans, providing funds for the region, and in the process propelling Andal Senior to \"undreamed-of heights of power\", according to a report by the International Crisis Group.\nIn 2006, Mrs Arroyo issued an executive order legalising the informal private \"armies\" being kept by families like the Ampatuans, enabling them to work alongside the regular army - but by extension legitimising their use as a means of local control.\nIn return the Ampatuans openly supported her in election campaigns.\nThere are widespread claims that the family helped rig votes for Mrs Arroyo in the controversial 2004 election, which she narrowly won. Both the Ampatuans and the former president deny the allegations.\nAt the time of the massacre, the clan had an estimated 28 mansions, scores of luxury cars, large amounts of rice-producing land and a heavily armed private army of more than 2,000 men.\nAccording to the International Crisis Group, the Ampatuans also controlled the police, the judiciary and the local election commission, and possessed mortars, rocket launchers and assault rifles.\nEven now, after the finger of blame has been pointed at them for the November massacre, the family still retains a lot of its influence. At least 15 Ampatuans won victories in May's election - some of whom have charges against them.\nAnd according to Jessica Evans from Human Rights Watch, Andal Senior is still able to give orders to his subordinates from inside jail.\nOf course none of this means the Ampatuans are necessarily guilty of the killings, or that all members of the clan act in a similar way.\nIn fact, according to Amina Rasul, director of the Philippine Council on Islam and Democracy, some Ampatuans are very effective and popular community leaders.\n\"They're not all cut from the same cloth. Many are professional, and have real support,\" she said.\nBut human rights groups are still concerned about the dominance of these family clans, and they warn that the influence and power exhibited by the Ampatuans is by no means unique.\n\"I don't think this is an isolated incident,\" said Amina Rasul. \"There are other families in other parts of the Philippines that are just as powerful.\"\nThe Philippine military recently admitted that there were at least 112 private armies around the country - an indication, perhaps, of how many more clans and family groups hold sway over their own private fiefdoms.\nWhether by chance or design, presidential policies over the past few decades have given certain families the opportunity to amass extraordinary levels of power and influence.\nThe first priority of the trial into last November's massacre is undoubtedly to bring justice for those who were so brutally killed.\nBut human rights groups are hoping that the case will also persuade the current government, under President Benigno Aquino, to bring an end to the dominance of families like the Ampatuans.", "summary": "The main suspect in the most brutal massacre in recent Philippine history has gone on trial.", "id": "11139653"}

They could also be used to improve tools for minimally-invasive surgery.\nIn one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues built up layers of criss-crossed nanometre-scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet.\nTogether, the stack acts as what is known as a thin-film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure-sensitive layer on top.\nThe amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow.\nThe team demonstrated the flexibility of their TFT stacks by bending them to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin's performance.\n\"Javey's work is a nice demonstration of their capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach.\nThe heart of Professor Bao's devices is micro-structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re-creating the functionality of the Berkeley group's skins with less layers.\n\"Instead of laminating a pressure-sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, we made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News.\n\"Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to its original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" she added.\nThe overall flexibility of the Stanford group's skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop her group's approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed.\nNevertheless, both groups demonstrate that their skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high.\nThose numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques.\nJohn Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials.\n\"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how they elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well-established processing technologies to engineer low-cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" he wrote.\nHowever, he notes that there are still \"significant opportunities for further innovation\", such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail they could \"feel\", as well as improvements that could make large-area arrays possible and affordable.", "summary": "\"Artificial skin\" that could bring a sensitive touch to robots and prosthetic limbs, has been shown off.", "id": "11265415"}

Not so much an economic necessity as a political project driven by an ideological clamour for a minimal state.\n\"What they take apart now could take generations to rebuild. Decent public services are the glue that holds a civilised society together and we diminish them at our peril. Cut services, put jobs in peril and increase inequality, that's the way to make Britain a darker, brutish, more frightening place.\"\nHe said no-one took industrial action lightly, but added: \"Where members, faced with attacks on jobs, pay or pensions take a democratic decision for industrial action, they will have the support of unions and the TUC stands ready to co-ordinate that.\"\nBBC business reporter Simon Jack said no dates had been named for industrial action - but the motion meant unions were \"standing ready\" to do so if necessary, although there was no detail of what form it could take. He said the first co-ordinated action was not likely to take place until February or March 2011.\nBy Ben WrightPolitical correspondent, BBC News\nMinisters have spent the summer softening the public up for cuts but, with big job losses looming, the unions haven't been persuaded.\nBrendan Barber called the government's assertions \"insulting claptrap\".\nSome trade union leaders, such as Bob Crow and Mark Serwotka, predict civil disobedience and coordinated strike action in response to cuts. But moderates like Mr Barber want to temper the tone and place the union movement at the centre of an alliance with the public, charities and community groups who oppose the cuts.\nSo talk of a new winter of discontent may be wide of the mark, not least because secondary picketing is now illegal. But also because union leaders like Barber will be very wary about embarking on strike action that hits the users of public services hard and risks turning their members into villains.\nThe government wants to sound moderate too, hence Francis Maude's insistence he wants to see engagement and \"partnership\" between the unions and ministers. But confrontation looks likely so long as there's a chasm between the Treasury and the unions on how to deal with the deficit.\nWhat is the Trades Union Congress?\nOnly one delegate spoke against the motion, Jim McAuslan, general secretary of the airline pilots' union BALPA. He said it might be seen as an \"open goal\" for the government, and warned some union colleagues were \"getting the tone wrong\" in resisting every cut and they had to get the message out beyond unions to the wider community.\nRail, Maritime and Transport Workers' (RMT) leader Bob Crow has called for a campaign of \"civil disobedience\" but Mr Barber told the BBC he thought that was \"counter-productive\".\nInstead he said he favoured \"a broad-based campaign... to look to harness public opinion behind the case for a different approach to managing our economy.\"\nHe spoke against a purely critical campaign, asking unions to promote an \"alternative to austerity that encourages growth and jobs\".\nCabinet Office Minister Francis Maude told the BBC: \"We will listen very carefully to what they [the unions] say and the arguments that they make, there's no question about that. We are not going back to the days where there's a complete stand-off between the trade unions and the government. Those days are gone.\"\nBut he said the coalition government had \"inherited a terrible budget deficit\" and was having to borrow \u00a31 out of every \u00a34 \"just to keep the lights on\".\nHe said it was \"absolutely necessary\" to eradicate the budget deficit - to stop interest rates going up and \"choking off\" the recovery.\nHe said the government wanted to protect front-line services and jobs and had spent months renegotiating with the government's suppliers to cut costs, to try to protect as many jobs as possible.\nDowning Street also said the government wanted \"a genuine partnership with the trade unions\".\nThe PM's spokesman said. \"We need to deal with the deficit, we want to work with everyone in tackling that.\"\nFor all the rhetoric of the union leaders, the BBC's Political Editor Nick Robinson said it would be up to individual members whether to take strike action in ballots over the coming months.\nBut he said there were growing indications of disquiet among council workers and police officers.\nDave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison public services union, is calling for united action to defeat the government's \"austerity agenda\".\nA special BBC News season examining the approaching cuts to public sector spending\nThe Spending Review: Making It Clear\nUnite, the UK's biggest union, says it wants a \"robust campaign\" to protect public services, while the GMB argues that three-quarters of a million jobs could be at risk.\nThe RMT accuses ministers of launching \"all-out class warfare\".\nThe government is not sending a minister to address the congress but Business Secretary Vince Cable has said he will be willing to speak to representatives to discuss their concerns.\nActing Labour leader Harriet Harman addressed the TUC while the five candidates to become leader made their pitches to union delegates in the final hustings of the campaign.\nEach stressed their solidarity with the trade unions in the face of the anticipated spending squeeze but David Miliband said critics of the cuts needed to win the political arguments while brother Ed Miliband called for a \"responsible approach\" to opposition.\nThe TUC congress is the curtain-raiser for the party conference season and will be followed over the next three weeks by events held by the Lib Dems, Labour and the Conservatives.", "summary": "Union delegates have backed joint industrial action if \"attacks\" on jobs, pensions and public services go ahead.", "id": "11278570"}

If she can get to see a corpse within days of its death,  when that person died can be worked out to an accuracy within hours.\nBut, if the body has lain undiscovered for weeks, or even months, then the precision of timing can be narrowed to a matter of days.\nThis timing can even be used to help determine whether a suspicious death should be treated as murder.\n\"In some cases of assault, if someone has been seen leaving a pub after a fight say, then that person is found dead a few days later, if we can determine when they died to a matter of hours, we can help establish whether the person died from the assault or other causes.\"\nThe time of year can dramatically affect how a body decomposes. In one case Amoret and colleagues were involved in, a man disappeared in November but his body was not discovered until the following February.\nOne pathologist report suggested the body had been dead for just a few weeks. In fact because he had died in winter his body had effectively been \"mummified\".\nThe critical evidence came from Calliphora vicina, a bluebottle blowfly often found on dead bodies. C vicina grows all year round but in winter its development slows right down. While it remains alive, it becomes inactive at temperatures below 1C.\nThis peculiarly slow rate of development meant Amoret and colleagues could prove the man had died months ago rather than weeks.\nThe man had left a pub, taken a short-cut home then slipped and broken his neck.\nThe police regularly use Amoret and her colleagues' expertise.\n\"We can go two months with nothing but then be asked to help with six cases in a couple of weeks.\"\n\"It's rare that our evidence is used in court. It's more common that we give police a time window and they can then gather further evidence.\"\nForensic entomology can even be used in cases of burnt bodies, as insects may still be found, feeding within the body cavities. If a cadaver has been burnt this makes estimating time of death difficult for the pathologist.\nBetween working with police in the UK and research at the Natural History Museum, Amoret also works at the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.\nThere she compares the decomposition of dead pigs and human cadavers. Some people have nicknamed this place the \"body farm\".\nIn the summers of 2008 and 2009 she compared the decomposition of three pigs and three human cadavers.\nHer research isn't finalised but initial results are positive, confirming that pigs are a good model for how a human corpse decays.\n\"The same species of insects are attracted during the same time periods to both types of cadaver.  Large numbers of blowflies from days 1-5, fewer on days 6-7, and a large drop from day eight onwards,\" she told BBC News.\nShe also says this research will be very useful for all cases where insect evidence is used.\n\"This work will have a big impact when it's published, for forensic entomologists all over the world.  As it will show that pigs are a good model for humans, and therefore all the data gathered using pig cadavers can be applied to cases involving human cadavers.\"\nAmoret Whitaker is just one of the scientists demonstrating their research at the one night only event \"After Hours: Science Uncovered\" at the Natural History Museum on Friday 24th September between 1600 and 2200", "summary": "At the top of a long staircase in a room in a tower, far away from the throng of visitors and other scientists and laboratories is the Natural History Museum's insectory.", "id": "11375357"}

Some argue that people can quickly sink into a cycle of debt, with many lenders charging exorbitant rates of interest.\nDr Qazi Kholikuzzaman Ahmad, chairman of PKSF, a body that monitors microfinance, describes microcredit as a \"death trap\" for the poor.\nHe explains how poor people often take up the loans without thinking of the consequences, and that 60% of borrowers take loans from several sources.\n\"There is no understanding that it might take 10 or 20 years to repay their loan,\" he says.\nFurthermore, from the weekly repayments, some lenders deduct 10% of that payment for compulsory saving schemes - money the company then uses to lend to other people.\n\"Interest on repayments begin at around 15%, but it is a flat rate and can soon rise to anything between 40% and 100%,\" Dr Ahmad says.\nRepayments are generally due on loans from the first week after they are taken out, which does not give the borrower enough time to establish any form of income-earning enterprise.\nTo cover those first payments, people often resort to taking out a further loan from a different company.\nMs Rani used her loan to buy six cows but after her crops were destroyed she had to sell three of them, at half the market price, to enable her to repay her loan.\n\"I was hoping to save the remaining cows but they had to be sold as well,\" she laments.\nWomen are the main borrowers in the village and they were attracted to microcredit because they could get the loans easily and quickly.\nMoney is not always used as capital investment.

{"document": "As no single party or bloc commands a majority of the 325 seats in parliament, the contenders have had to forge new partnerships and deals in their efforts to share out the positions of power.\nThis is the main Shia parliamentary bloc. It was formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA).\nThe National Alliance decided in October to support Mr Maliki's bid for a second term as premier, but the decision was reportedly not unanimous.\nSTATE OF LAW COALITION: This grouping - which merged with the Iraqi National Alliance to form the National Alliance - is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power.\nThe bloc purportedly cut across religious and tribal lines. It included Mr Maliki's Shia Islamist Dawa [Call] Party as well as some Sunni tribal leaders, Shia Kurds, Christians and independents.\nMr Maliki said the alliance wanted an Iraq built on nationalist principles.\nHowever, many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that he truly believes they should be given a large share of power.\nMr Maliki hoped to capitalise on successes of his first term in office. However, his record on security was undermined by a series of high-profile attacks on government targets in Baghdad before the March elections.\nIRAQI NATIONAL ALLIANCE (INA): This mainly Shia alliance - which merged with the State of Law Coalition - includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr.\nIt brings together the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council (IISC), the Basra-based Fadhilah party, a few Sunni leaders, former prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari, and Ahmad Chalabi - the former exile who played a key role before the 2003 US-led invasion.\nJaafari was prime minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006 and his reputation was tainted by the fact that militias took over the security services while he was in charge, and by the sectarian war that ensued.\nA senior leader of the IISC is outgoing Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi.\nThe Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\nThe Kurdistan Democratic Party led by the region's president, Masood Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Iraq's outgoing national president, Jalal Talabani, are both secular in nature and enjoy close ties with the West.\nThe two parties faced a major challenge in Kurdistan's parliamentary vote this year from the Reform (Change) bloc, which won about a quarter of the seats.\nThe Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction.\nThis alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern.\nIt is led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis who view him as a strongman capable of countering Shia power Iran.\nThe alliance includes outgoing Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, and senior Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq. They ran on a nationalist platform.\nWhile all of the major coalitions have adopted a rhetoric of ''national unity'', al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals.\nThis group brings together a range of significant political figures, including Interior Minister Jawad Bolani and a leader of the Sunni anti-al-Qaeda militia in al-Anbar province, Ahmad Abu-Risha.\nUnity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list, probably prompting suggestions that key figures in the list, such as Abu-Risha, appeared to have been seriously considering joining Mr Maliki.\nLike al-Iraqiyya, the Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links.\nThe Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. It includes Speaker of the last parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai.\nIt consists of some tribal leaders and the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), which has increased its political visibility over recent years, enhancing its claim to represent Iraqi Sunnis at a national level.\nTribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006.\nWhile the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs.\nSmaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant.\nBBC Monitoring selects and translates news from radio, television, press, news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages.

{"document": "But what's really in a place name?\nShould Beddau in Rhondda Cynon Taf be pronounced \"Bather\", as many of the locals do, or \"Beth-eye\" according to its roots in Welsh?\nA group of geographical and historical experts from around Wales say Welsh place names are particularly important, as they tend to be descriptive of the conditions at the time of naming, whereas English place-names are subject to obscure influences from Latin, German, French and Scandinavian languages.\nDespite the rich source of information which they could hold, Wales does not have a national place-name body monitoring trends and derivations, as does Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.\nYet a conference this weekend, organised by The Snowdonia National Park, Cymdeithas Edward Llwyd and the Welsh Assembly Government is aiming to change that, by drawing together historians, geographers and linguists to form Wales' own place name society.\nTwm Elias of Snowdonia's Plas Tan y Bwlch study centre, has helped organise the Ll\u00ean Natur conference, and explained:\n\"It's not so much how people pronounce place-names today, it's about recording how locations have been named, written and pronounced over time.\"\n\"People who live in Beddau are welcome to call it 'Bather' or 'Beth-eye' as they choose; it's their town after all!  But if we forget that the town's name comes from Beddau, the Welsh for graves, then we'd be losing an understanding of its possible roots as an ancient, pre-Christian burial site.\"\nBut whilst the true meaning of Beddau's name is not fully understood, many other historical, socio-economic, and environmental riddles have been solved through the study of how our ancestors named their lands.\nThrough the name of D\u00f4l-y-Pennau in Snowdonia ( which translates into \"Meadow of Heads\"), members of the Ll\u00ean Natur project were able to point archaeologists to the previously-undiscovered site of a massacre between feuding Welsh princes, which resulted in dozens of people being beheaded before their heads were discarded in a field in the area named in their memory.\nA study of a concentration in eastern Wales, of places bearing the suffix 'Wern' or 'Gwern' has similarly lent fresh understanding to the trade links between medieval Wales and the Norman Marcher states.\nGwern derives from the Welsh for alder tree, the willow-like wood from which was used to manufacture clogs for agricultural workers.\nWhile the trees are native throughout Wales, the frequency of Wern and Gwern in the east of the country pointed historians towards studying potential sites where they may have been grown on a commercial basis, for sale to agricultural areas over the border in Herefordshire and Shropshire.\nBut not all the discoveries are of a purely historical nature.\nThe pine marten, a small mammal once native to Wales, is now facing extinction.\nHowever, the number of places which include 'bela' - Welsh for pine marten - in their name is testament to the frequency with which they were once found here.\nConservationists are using these places as a starting point to study satellite imagery for potential sites where pine martens may one day be re-introduced into the wild.\nThis weekend's conference is the culmination of years of work by Duncan Brown, a Welsh-speaker whose work for the Countryside Council for Wales led to his fascination with the links between  language and environment.\nBut he warned: \"It's sometimes dangerous to read too much into place names, or to take them too literally.\"\n\"For example, places with 'eos' suffixes derive from the Welsh for nightingale.  They're no longer native to Wales, and there's some debate whether they ever were.\n\"Yet there are two clusters of 'eos' names in Wales, one around Carmarthenshire and Glamorganshire, and another in the north, centred around Denbighshire  and northern Powys.\"\n\"The south Wales group are prefixed with terms like 'llwyn', a copse, or 'y-pant' , a hollow, which correspond with the natural habitat of nightingales.\"\n\"However, the group in the north have prefixes like 'llety'r', from the Welsh for a tavern or inn.\n\"So the reference to nightingale is far more likely to have originated from someone who sung there, with the voice of a nightingale.\"\nMessage of importance\nThe Ll\u00ean Natur conference is being opened with an address by Culture Minister Alun Ffred Jones.\nMr Brown is hoping this will prove indicative of more concrete support for the project.\n\"It's fantastic to have Alun Ffred along to speak anyway, as it's a real recognition of the hard work everyone has put in,\" he said.\n\"Everyone knows that there's not much money to go around at the moment, but inexpensive things could make a big difference.\"\n\"We've already made a huge start on a database of place-names and their origins on the Ll\u00ean Natur website, and with access to support from the assembly (government) we could go even further.\"\n\"Also, some within the group would like to see legislation brought before the assembly to prevent historic Welsh place names becoming anglicised or changed altogether to ones with no local significance.\"\n\"Even if the resources weren't available to police it rigorously, the simple presence of legislation would send out a message of the importance that Welsh place names continue to have to this day.\"", "summary": "Ask anyone from outside Wales to name something for which we're famous, and the odds are that the name of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch on Anglesey would rank in their top five.", "id": "11800957"}

{"document": "Scientists agree that such attacks are extremely rare - and that sharks are not the man-eaters depicted in Hollywood blockbusters such as Jaws.\nBut they will try to determine why the sharks were lured into shallow waters, and what prompted them to carry out a series of attacks that left one person dead and several more injured.\nSo far, two sharks - an oceanic white tip and a mako shark - have been caught by local fishermen, but experts say there is no evidence so far that either of them are responsible for the attacks.\nThere is an abundance of oceanic white tip sharks - Carcharhinus longimanus - in the Red Sea. Divers have spoken of diving with oceanic white tips without feeling threatened.\nSources: International Union for Conservation of Nature and International Shark Attack Files\nBut Ian Fergusson, a shark biologist and patron of the Shark Trust, a UK conservation organisation, said the presence of the short-fin mako shark was intriguing.\nOceanic white tips frequent the region but it was unusual for swimmers to encounter them in shallow waters, he said, and it was very rare for shortfin makos to be found in the Red Sea - and exceptionally rare to find them close to shore.\nHe said the last time a short-fin mako attacked in the area was in 1970s, when a tourist was wounded in an attack off Eilat's reefs.\nMr Fergusson, a regular visitor to the area, said it would not be difficult for a shark to get close to the shore in Sharm el-Sheikh.\n\"That particular part of the coastline is bordering on deep water. You don't have to go far offshore to find yourself in 500 metres of water. Sharks can get within half a mile of the shore easily. They don't, for example, have to cross reefs to get there.\"\nAccording to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack Files, there are an estimated 70-100 shark attacks on humans per year, resulting in about five to 15 deaths. Of those, the oceanic white tip is responsible for only a small number.\nBut the large oceanic sharks were also the main culprits behind countless attacks on sailors and airmen who, after air and sea battles, found themselves adrift in the Pacific during World War II.\nSo what could have prompted the latest attacks?\nThere has been speculation that animal carcasses were recently dumped into the Red Sea, not far off the shore. Some reports have suggested the remains could have been thrown overboard by a ship carrying animal cargo.\n\"If you start dumping carcasses, you couldn't ask for a better way of baiting for sharks,\" said Mr Fergusson.\nDavid Jacoby, who specialises in shark behavioural ecology at The Marine Biological Association of the UK, agreed that if this is the case, it was likely to be a significant factor in the sharks' behaviour.\n\"Pelagic, or oceanic, species of shark often feed opportunistically because the open ocean can be a sparse environment for food,\" he said.\nWhile less is known about the movements and behaviour of the oceanic white tip, compared with some other species, Mr Jacoby offered another possible explanation as to why the sharks might have been in shallow water.\nBased on evidence, experts know that in other shark species, larger females move into warmer, shallow waters to either aid gestation - which can be between 9-12 months in white tips depending on the temperature - or to pup, although from what little evidence there is, it seems that oceanic white tips probably pup in the early summer.\n\"Both species [white tips and makos] rarely encounter people as they spend large amounts of their time in blue water - open ocean,\" said Mr Jacoby.\n\"Like other species, the oceanic white tip is opportunistic and can be fairly aggressive. It is hard to speculate why they attack but they might if they felt they were threatened.\n\"They are not coming specifically to attack humans - they are not seen as a food source. But if a white tip or mako felt threatened, felt cornered by lots of people in the water, or next to a reef, for example, it might display more aggressive behaviour as a defence mechanism.\n\"They are opportunistic and it could just be a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\nOr, he said, they could be cases of mistaken identity - the shark misinterpreting a human for its normal prey.\nMr Jacoby said shiny objects in the water could attract attention from sharks - so if the sharks were already in the area, shiny jewellery might be a trigger.\nThere has also been speculation that sharks could have have moved to shallow water because of the depletion of local food sources in the area, but Mr Jacoby disagrees with this.\n\"This would surely have the opposite effect,\" he said.\nHe explains that sharks adopt search behaviour aiming to maximise their encounters with food sources. Therefore, there is likely to be a relationship between natural prey distributions - fish, squid etc - and shark distributions, as the sharks generally try and go where the food is.\nHowever, if a potential food source such as carcasses have been discarded close to shore, some sharks would naturally pick up on this and opportunistically feed there. This would increase the numbers of sharks in the area, making interactions with people more likely.\nIn the past, shark attacks on snorkellers have been blamed on shoddy diving practices such as \"chumming\" - attracting sharks by throwing solid bait or pouring chum, a mash of fish oil and blood, into the water.\nThis type of activity aims to attract sharks such as oceanic white tips, which tend to stay out in the ocean.\nBut Mr Fergusson said he didn't \"buy\" this theory.\n\"Recent studies in South Africa have shown that chumming has limited effect on shark behaviour.\n\"This is partly because these sharks are such migratory species, and mainly because this is a Marine National Park, any feeding is prohibited - anyone found doing it would be arrested and jailed.\"\nHe said a more compelling argument could be a continued decline in pelagic fish stocks having an impact on the natural foraging behaviour of certain shark species.\nWhile any degradation to the ecosystem of the local reef wouldn't necessarily affect the oceanic white tip because this is outside of its natural habitat, Mr Fergusson said this could \"point to a larger issue of general offshore fishing of tuna and other big fish whittling down and influencing the food chain\".\nIn Egypt, the hunt is still on for the shark that carried out the latest, fatal attack.\nMark Murphy, who runs a scuba diving holiday firm in London, told the BBC that the local authorities would probably aim to have a \"quick clean-up of the area\".\n\"There are over four million visitors a year to the Red Sea and there hasn't been a single incident within the last five years,\" said Mr Murphy.\n\"I am saddened that the Egyptian government has decided to slaughter sharks indiscriminately. Over 70 million sharks a year are killed by humans and they are an essential part of the marine ecosystem.\"\nIn any case, according to US-based shark expert Samuel Gruber, finding the predator or predators would be extremely difficult.", "summary": "International shark experts are arriving in Egypt to help investigate the attacks off the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh that have baffled local officials.", "id": "11926406"}

The government branded it a \"terrorist act\".\nSoon afterwards, the government proposed a tough \"anti-mara\" bill that makes it a criminal offence to belong to a gang or contribute to gang finances by paying extortion fees.\nIn addition, more than 6,000 soldiers - almost half of the army's manpower - have been deployed in hotspots around the country including border crossings, jails and areas with a strong \"mara\" presence.\nThis tougher stance was seen by many as preparation for the threat of Mexican cartels moving in to El Salvador.\nThe person who knows most about violence in El Salvador may well be Israel Ticas, a forensic investigator from the security ministry.\nHe is the sole official in charge of the exhumation of bodies buried in clandestine graveyards by the gangs.\nHe has already unearthed more than 38 of these graves around the country - and he believes there are dozens more still to be found.\nThe walls of his office in the capital are covered with pictures of the bodies, many of them too hard to digest for a casual observer.\nThey show men and women tortured, beheaded, mutilated; the violence seems to reach unimaginable levels.\nAnd, says Mr Ticas, the cruelty is only getting worse.\n\"In the last few years, the gangs have become more sophisticated\" in the way they bury their victims, he says.\n\"They hide [the bodies] better and it is harder for us to find them - now they leave a beheaded body in one site and the head is buried five kilometres [three miles] away.\"\nIt is hard to imagine how violence in El Salvador could go any further - and that is why many fear that the arrival of foreign organised criminal groups would be a nightmare come true.", "summary": "From a giant billboard in the Salvadorean capital, a man with a defiant attitude shows off a slogan on his shirt: \"No one can intimidate El Salvador,\" it reads.", "id": "12023116"}

From there, Megrahi was able to use as many as four false passports to travel to Zurich, where the timing device for the bomb was made.\nPan Am flight 103 left London's Heathrow Airport at 1825 GMT on 21 Dec 1988, bound for New York with 243 passengers and 16 crew members on board.\nAt just after 1900 an explosion in the plane's forward cargo hold tore the side out of the Boeing 747 which quickly broke up and fell onto the small town of Lockerbie in the Dumfries & Galloway region of Scotland.\nAs well as the 259 people on board the plane, 11 residents of Lockerbie died on the ground as a result of a giant fireball caused when a wing holding thousands of gallons of fuel exploded on impact.\nIt was scraps of clothes wrapped around the bomb which detonated aboard the airliner that led investigators to a shop in Malta and, eventually, to Megrahi.\nIn November 1991 Megrahi, and a fellow Libyan, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, were indicted by the Scottish Lord Advocate and the US Attorney General for the bombing of Flight 103.\nLibya refused to extradite the two men and Megrahi spent eight years living under armed guard - relying on a small LAA pension and work as a teacher - before he and his co-defendant were handed over for trial.\nEventually, after protracted negotiations with Libya, it was agreed the trial would be held under Scots law but in a neutral country.\nThe two men were handed over in 1999 and the trial finally began in May 2000 at Camp Zeist, a former US Air Force base in the Netherlands.\nIn television interviews shown to the court, Megrahi appeared gentle. He told reporters: \"I'm a quiet man. I never had any problem with anybody,\" and said he felt sorry for the people of Lockerbie.\nAfter nine months, three Scottish judges found him guilty and a subsequent appeal was rejected. He was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 27 years. Fhimah was acquitted of all charges.\nMegrahi served the first part of his sentence in Glasgow's Barlinnie prison, segregated in a high-security area dubbed \"Gaddafi's Cafe\", where there was said to be a sitting room and kitchen where halal food was specially prepared.\nThe former South African president Nelson Mandela, who had helped broker the deal which allowed the trial to take place, visited him there and called for him to be moved to a Muslim country to avoid harassment from other prisoners.\nHowever, in 2005, he was transferred to nearby HMP Greenock, where there were no special provisions and he mixed with other \"lifers\".\nMegrahi was given a fresh chance to clear his name when the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) referred his case back to appeal judges for a second time.\nIn October 2008 It was announced that Megrahi was suffering from prostate cancer and his lawyers urged the court to speed up the appeal process.\nThe hearing, which began in April  2009, had the backing of ex-Labour MP Tam Dalyell and Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing.\nHowever, in Aug 2009, Megrahi abruptly withdrew his appeal and on 20 August the Scottish Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill, granted his release on compassionate grounds and he was flown back to Libya.\nThe decision caused a storm of protest from politicians in both the UK and the United States, not least because of what was termed his \"hero's welcome\" when he arrived home in Tripoli.\nThe UK justice secretary, Jack Straw, was forced to publicly deny allegations that the British government had sanctioned Megrahi's release in the interests of improving trade relations with Libya.\nMegrahi always maintained that he was innocent, a view that was shared by some commentators and relatives of the victims.\nIn a statement released by his lawyers, Megrahi said: \"Many people, including the relatives of those who died in, and over, Lockerbie, are, I know, upset that my appeal has come to an end; that nothing more can be done about the circumstances surrounding the Lockerbie bombing. I share their frustration. I had most to gain and nothing to lose about the whole truth coming out - until my diagnosis of cancer.\"\nConsiderable doubt has been raised over the safety of Megrahi's conviction, and a number of conspiracy theories have circulated over the years as to who was responsible for the outrage.\nThe withdrawal of his second appeal, and his subsequent death, has, according to some observers, made it less likely that the truth about the bombing of Pan Am 103 will ever be known.", "summary": "Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on 21 Dec 1988.", "id": "12174643"}

One group was asked to begin an exercise regimen of walking around a track for 40 minutes a day, three days a week, while the others were limited to doing simple stretching and toning exercises.\nBrain scans and memory tests were performed at the start of the study, halfway through the study and again at the end.\nScans revealed hippocampus volume increased by around 2% in people who did regular aerobic exercise. The same region of the brain decreased in volume by 1.4% in those who did stretching exercises, consistent with the decrease seen in normal ageing.\nBoth groups showed some improvement over time on memory tests.

His visit to the United States was the first by a Burmese leader in 46 years.\nThein Sein, 67, took office in March 2011, after the country's first election in 20 years in November 2010. Since then, he has led a process of reform in Myanmar, ruled for decades by a military junta of which he was a key member.\nUnder his administration the government has freed hundreds of prisoners, including political detainees, embarked on peace deals with ethnic minority groups and relaxed media censorship.\nHe has been welcomed cautiously onto the world stage, despite warnings from critics that many key tests remain for Myanmar's reform process.\nThis warning was echoed in November 2014 by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who said that the pace of reform had stalled.\nBorn in a small village in the delta of the Irrawaddy river, in an area now known as Ngapudaw township, Thein Sein was from a humble background.  His parents were farmers, he said.\nHe graduated with an arts degree from Burma's military academy in 1968 and rose steadily through the ranks in his 40-year career.\nHe reached the leadership circle in the 1990s when he became a member of the State Peace and Development Council, as the junta called itself at the time.\nHe was made first secretary of the council after the downfall of former intelligence chief General Khin Nyunt in 2004. Thein Sein also chaired the National Convention, which drafted the country's new constitution.\nWhen the previous prime minister, Soe Win, fell ill, Thein Sein was made acting prime minister in May 2007.\nConfirmed in the post in October that year, he became the public face of the regime, representing it at Asean and UN meetings. He served as prime minister for four years.\nIn April 2010, like many other top junta officials, he swapped military uniform for civilian garb to form a political party.\nIt was Thein Sein who applied to register the United Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which dominated the elections in November 2010 and has sweeping control of the parliament.\nAnalysts said at the time that his appointment was orchestrated by junta leader Than Shwe, who needed an acceptable face to front the country's transition.\n\"He won't rock the boat,\" said Aung Zaw, editor of the Thailand-based Irrawaddy magazine, speaking when he took office.\n\"He is not a fire-breathing dragon, so he doesn't pose any threat to Than Shwe, who will continue to exercise absolute power.\"\nBut once he took office, Thein Sein's government began a process of change that surprised his critics.\nHe met freed pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who subsequently chose to bring her NLD party back into the political process, having boycotted the November polls.\nThe NLD contested by-elections which were deemed by observers to be largely free and fair.\nOver the years since her release Thein Sein appears to have developed a good working relationship with Ms Suu Kyi.   Media reports made much of the fact that he met her, congratulated her on receiving the US Congressional Medal of Honor and referred to her as a Nobel laureate publicly.\nKnown to be quiet by nature, Thein Sein has engaged more with international media.  He began a steady push for the West to lift sanctions, something he said was a necessity for democracy to thrive and the lives of Myanmar's people to improve.\n\"There is a quiet determination to him, he is quiet and soft-spoken but will not flinch from a question posed to him,\" Vijay Nambiar, the UN's top adviser on Myanmar, told Bloomberg.\nAsked in a BBC interview whether he was afraid he would be swept away by the winds of change like Mikhail Gorbachev after the fall of the Soviet Union, Thein Sein answered: \"I would like to say that Gorbachev and I are not alike, I tell you that.\n''We are not making reforms because I want to.

{"document": "This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.  I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I've been sleeping here most of the time since.\nOur social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks.\nI like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline.\nThis is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square.\nAt the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection.  I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through.\nI hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet.\nTwitter: Amr Gharbeia\nI was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground.\nAt first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping.\nNow I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom.\nBlogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people.\nTwitter: Nawara Negm\nI'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square.\nThe internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger.\nIn the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It's like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution.\nBlog: MaLek X (in Arabic)\nThe revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn't think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I'm sure that those who named the date didn't think things would go this far.\nTo begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard.\nAfter our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died.\nStill the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we're collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: \"We're really proud of you... You did what we didn't manage to do for 60 years.\"\nPeople have called this the \"Facebook Revolution\" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked.\nIn the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I've been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don't know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to.\nWe're finally getting to know each other. It's wonderful.", "summary": "Egypt's internet activists have played a key role in the pro-democracy protests from the outset, but they tell the BBC that the online campaigning is evolving to suit their real-life activism in Tahrir Square.", "id": "12381295"}

The day of live Beatles music starts with a lunchtime session at 1300 GMT.\nA 40-metre long light installation is being created across Mathew Street, called Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It will create a ceiling of light along the Cavern Quarter area.\nThe original Cavern had started life as a jazz venue in 1957 but by 1961 it was moving towards rock and roll - driven more by plain economics than any change in musical taste.\nPromoter Sam Leach was instrumental in transforming the Cavern's music policy away from the jazz favoured by owner Ray McFall.\nMr Leach said: \"It was a good club and it was exciting.\n\"Ray McFall hated rock and roll. On March 11th 1961, I did the Iron Door (a rival Liverpool club)  - I did an all night session and it got 1,800 people, that night the Cavern had 50 people in, more musicians than fans.\n\"Ten days later...Ray gets the message and he turns over to rock and roll at night. Up until then The Beatles only played at lunchtime.\"\nThe Beatles had played other Merseyside venues since returning from Hamburg in late 1960, but it was at the Cavern that they would cement their reputation as one of the city's top rock and roll groups.\nMany who saw The Beatles at the club claim that was where they were at their best as a live outfit. Mr Leach's first taste of The Beatles was at a venue in Huyton.\nHe said: \"When I first saw them in Hamilton Hall as soon as they started playing, I was just gobsmacked.\n\"The sound didn't just go over you it went through you.\n\"John Lennon started with Slow Down and Paul did Hippy Hippy Shake, Stuart did Wooden Heart, Pete Best did Matchbox. The sound was so powerful, it seemed to reverberate around the hall.\n\"We more or less took American rock and roll and sent it back at them improved. We gave them better sound, which was Merseybeat.\n\"Make no mistake the Cavern has become the most famous club in the world.\n\"It makes me smile when they say: 'The Cavern where it all began' - they were the last ones in. But it was an exciting club.\"\nIn November 1961, record store manager Brian Epstein saw The Beatles at the Cavern and soon after became their manager.\nA record deal with Parlophone would follow but not before the band's sound and image had been subtlety changed.\n\"The Beatles were the best rock band on the planet\", Mr Leach remembers.\n\"Eppy [Brian Epstein] took them and he groomed them, and took all that rawness out of them, and fair enough it worked. But I know John didn't like it because John was an out and out rock and roller.\n\"Paul was sensible he knew you had to sort of bend a little bit and become a bit more showbiz.

{"document": "So what is the levy? What's really at stake? And why raise the rate now?\nWhat is the bank levy?\nIt is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that:\nOriginally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May.\nThe standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January.\nWhat's it for?\nThe government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous.\nThe tax will also raise a lot of money for the government.\nSo will this help deal with the budget deficit?\nThe Treasury hopes the tax will bring in \u00a32.6bn every year.\nThat's equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for the budget deficit this year.\nIt's no small amount for the banks either. It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five.\nWhat's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage?\nTraditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies.\nBut during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets.\nUnlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again.\nA lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days.\nWhen the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts.\nThis caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend.\nUnable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure.\nWhy are retail deposits exempt from the levy?\nBank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock.\nBut since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs. Indeed, the government responded to the Northern Rock crisis by promising to guarantee all of its deposits.\nIn the UK, the first \u00a385,000 of an individual's money is insured (it used to be \u00a335,000 before the financial crisis).\nThis means that most depositors do not need to worry about the safety of their money during a financial crisis, and the banks don't need to worry about all those deposits being withdrawn.\nSo why not just insure all the banks' borrowings?\nThe bank levy was actually first proposed to all countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a type of insurance scheme.\nThe IMF said the money raised should be channelled into a special fund that could be used to pay for the cost of cleaning up future banking crises.\nHowever, the UK government took the view that these borrowings are inherently risky, and wanted to discourage them altogether by taxing them.\nIf the debts were insured, lenders would see them as less risky, making them a cheaper and easier way for banks to borrow.\nThe government's fear is that the banks would then just continue taking on more and more debt, until they became impossibly large to rescue - as proved the case in the Republic of Ireland or Iceland.\nIndeed, the total debts of the UK's banks had already reached a staggering 4.5 times the size of the entire UK economy before the crisis.\nSome might also point out another reason why the government chose not to go for an insurance scheme.\nBy making it a tax instead, the revenue raised can be channelled straight to the Treasury, helping to pay for the government's own spending.\nWhy is the first \u00a320bn of debts exempt from the tax?\nThe government wants to encourage banks to shrink.\nThe thinking is that the collapse of a big bank could threaten the stability of the entire financial system, whereas the failure of a small bank should not.\nThe \u00a320bn figure is about the size of the Coventry Building Society. So it means banks will only pay the tax to the extent they are bigger than that.\nWhy is the tax rate lower on long-term debts?\nLonger-term debts are inherently less risky.\nFinancial crises - at least the most intense part of them - tend to be over in a matter of a few weeks or months.\nIf a bank does not have to repay its debts for more than a year, then it can probably ride out the crisis.\nWill the levy really discourage banks?\nThe tax will increase the cost of \"risky\" short-term borrowing for banks by just under one-tenth of a percentage point.\nThis may seem small, but it will eat into the banks' precious margins - the difference between the interest they pay on their deposits and what they earn on their lending - which is their main source of income.\nHowever, the banks may pass some of the tax cost on to their savers (via a lower deposit rate) or their borrowers (via a higher lending rate).\nBut to get the 0.088% in context, the Bank of England slashed short-term borrowing costs by 5.2 percentage points in response to the financial crisis.\nWhy did the government want to phase the levy in?\nThe original plan was to charge 0.05% for 2011, before going up to the full 0.075% rate next year (increased to 0.078% in March).\nThe government didn't want to raise the banks' borrowing costs at a time when their financial stability was still in question.\nThey also did not want to sap the banks' profits too quickly.\nThe banks might need to use all the profits they could get to rebuild their capital - their buffer against future losses - in order to meet tough new international standards being set by the Basel committee of banking regulators.\nSo why did the government change its mind?\nIn February, the Treasury said it wanted to charge the full \u00a32.6bn this year after all.\nIt pointed to the Bank of England's latest Financial Stability Report, which painted a much rosier picture of the UK's banks.\nMoreover, the new Basel rules on bank capital won't take full effect until 2019, giving banks a full eight years to meet the higher standards.\nIt probably also helped that the banks have been reporting much better profits than many would have expected a year ago.\nAnd markets seemed less and less concerned about the risk of lending to banks - at least until the eurozone debt crisis flared up since the summer of 2011.\nWhy is the government raising the rate again?\nThe chancellor raised the rate to 0.088% in his Autumn Statement.\nAccording to the Treasury, the tax was not on course to raise the \u00a32.6bn originally planned for this year.\nThe Treasury said that it had simply overestimated how much borrowing is done by foreign banks in the UK - and is therefore subject to the tax.\nIt could also be that banks have been reducing their borrowing. Foreign banks may be moving their borrowing offshore to avoid the tax.\nAnd all banks may be cutting back their borrowing and lending requirements in response to the recession, the eurozone financial crisis, and stricter regulatory requirements.\nWhich banks will have to pay most?\nThe Treasury does not say how much of its \u00a32.6bn target it expects to be paid by each bank.\nBritish banks face a bigger burden than foreign banks that do business in the UK, because the British banks must pay the levy on all their borrowing worldwide, and not just on their borrowing in the UK.\nThat has led to suggestions that some banks - perhaps Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays - may relocate their headquarters to another country in order to reduce their tax bill.\nMoreover, the probability is that the tax will hit Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group hardest.\nIt may seem perverse to tax most heavily the two banks in which the government has the biggest stake.\nBut one of the reasons the government ended up owning these banks is precisely because they (in the case of Lloyds, because of its merger with the Halifax) had become too dependent on riskier forms of financing, and had to be rescued during the crisis.", "summary": "The government says it will increase the levy on banks from 0.078% to 0.088% from 1 January.", "id": "12391532"}
{"document": "Alex McKechnie, then 16, was in the crowd for that first show and went on to be a regular at the club:\n\"I saw The Beatles a few times in the north end of Liverpool and was working in Liverpool city centre as a messenger boy in a printing works when I heard that they were on at the Cavern in a lunchtime session.\n\"The Cavern was in the basement of a three or four storey warehouse. The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches.\n\"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times.\n\"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there.\n\"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.\n\"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.\n\"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.\n\"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.\n\"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.\n\"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\n\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\n\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\n\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\n\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work.\n\"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again.\n\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them.\n\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\n\"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me.\"\nAlex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.\nThe Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday.

{"document": "During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK.\nHe worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees.\nYet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge.\nNicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London.\nHis Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton.\nThey had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised.\nIn 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics.\nHe continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin.\nIn 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London.\nHis mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis.\nIn December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees.\nHe visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France.\nBritish activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home.\nHe was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home.\nWinton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.\nOn his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of  initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories.\nWinton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy.\n\"The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway,\" he said.\n\"It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help.\n\"I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had.\"\nIn the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden.\nThe ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two.\n\"Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared,\" Winton later recalled. \"None of the 250 children on board was seen again.\n\"We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through.\"\nWinton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned.\nHe told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children.\nIn July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend.\nUntil they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them.\nWinton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport.\nIn 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.\nA train dubbed \"The Winton Train\" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital.\nIn October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion.\nIn his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: \"In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today.\"\nIt was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis:\n\"In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed.\n\"The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference.

{"document": "John Key said the toll was expected to rise further, adding: \"We may be witnessing New Zealand's darkest day.\"\nThe tremor caused widespread damage as it occurred at a shallow depth of 5km (3.1 miles) during lunchtime when Christchurch was at its busiest.\nThe mayor of New Zealand's second-biggest city says 120 people have been rescued from the ruins.\nThe country's deadliest natural disaster in 80 years struck at 1251 (2351 GMT on Monday), 10km (6.2 miles) south-east of the city.\nThe damage is said to be far worse than after the 7.1-magnitude quake on 4 September, which left two people seriously injured but no fatalities.\nChristchurch earthquake: Eyewitness accounts\nThe epicentre of that quake, which occurred in the middle of the night, was further away from the city and deeper underground, but it still caused an estimated $3bn (\u00c2\u00a31.9bn) in damage.\nTV pictures of the aftermath of Tuesday's disaster showed scores of collapsed buildings in the South Island city of nearly 400,000 people.\nShocked survivors could be seen wandering the rubble-strewn streets, which cracked open as the ground beneath was liquefied by the tremor.\nPolice said that the dead included people on two buses which were crushed by falling buildings.\nHelicopters plucked survivors to safety from rooftops, and dumped water on fires.\nOfficials said up to 30 people were feared still trapped inside the razed Pyne Gould Guinness building, where screams have been heard from the ruins.\nTrapped under her desk inside the building, Anne Voss told Australia's Channel Seven by mobile phone: \"I am hoping they will get me out soon because I have been here so long. And it's dark. And it's horrible.\"\nAsked whether she was injured, she said: \"I know I am bleeding and I can feel the ground is quite wet. I think it's blood.\"\nA dozen visiting Japanese students are among those reported missing.\nBystanders have been using bare hands to try to free survivors trapped under debris.\nMany injured people were carried out on blood-soaked stretchers or in the arms of shocked workmates and strangers.\nSome escaped on ropes lowered from office towers. Others managed to crawl out of the rubble.\nBy Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News\nBy nature, earthquakes tend to cluster in space and time.\nAnd Tuesday's tremor in Christchurch is almost certainly related to the much more energetic event that hit the region last September.\nThe critical difference on this occasion is the ground broke almost directly under the country's second city, and at shallow depth, 5km (3 miles) below the surface.\nContrast this with September's magnitude 7 quake: its epicentre occurred some 40km west of the city and at a depth of 10km, and it continued to rupture mainly away from the major built-up areas.\nNew Zealand lies on the notorious Ring of Fire, the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.\nThe country straddles the boundary between two tectonic plates: the Pacific and Indo-Australian plates.\nOn South Island, the location of the latest quake, the plates rub past each other horizontally.\nDepth and location key\nThe tremor sent the spire of Christchurch Cathedral, a landmark in the centre of the city, toppling into the square below.\nJohn Gurr, a camera technician, told Reuters news agency the area outside the cathedral was \"like a warzone\".\nPower and telephone lines have been knocked out, while burst pipes have deluged streets with water.\nThe suburbs of Lyttelton and New Brighton are reportedly \"unliveable\".\nQueen Elizabeth II said in a statement she had been \"utterly shocked\" by the news.\n\"My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this dreadful event,\" the statement said.\nThe quake caused some 30m tons of ice to shear away from New Zealand's biggest glacier.\nWitnesses say massive icebergs formed when the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park broke, tossing a nearby lake with huge waves.\nBack in Christchurch, emergency shelters were set up in the city's Hagley Park, a race course and schools as night approached.\nCity Mayor Bob Parker told the BBC: \"This is a terrible, terrible toll on our city.\"\n\"There is no power in most of the city; there is no water in most of the city,\" he added.\nPM John Key said: \"It is just a scene of utter devastation. We have to work as fast as we can to get people out of environments where they are trapped.\n\"This is a community that is absolutely in agony. We just need this community, as it has done before and as it will do again, to come together, to check and support one another,\" he added.\nThe military has been deployed to help the rescue effort, and the government has accepted an offer of specialist help from Australia.\nA series of aftershocks, some as big as magnitude 5, have already rattled the stricken city, and officials warned residents to brace for more.\nOne Christchurch resident, Jaydn Katene, told the New Zealand Herald: \"We've had friends in town call us and say there are just bodies lying around; lots of dead bodies outside shops just lying there just covered in bricks.\"\nA British backpacker said the city \"looked like a bomb had hit it\".\nNew Zealand experiences more than 14,000 earthquakes a year, of which only around 20 have a magnitude in excess of 5.0.\nThe last fatal earthquake was in 1968, when a 7.1-magnitude tremor killed three people on the South Island's western coast.\nTuesday's was the country's worst natural disaster since a 1931 quake in the North Island city of Napier killed 256 people.", "summary": "New Zealand's prime minister says at least 65 people have died after a 6.3-magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch.", "id": "12533291"}

{"document": "More than a new way of playing video games, a cynic might say.\nSpecial Report: The Technology of Business\nDigital death of a business card?\nMobile advertisers want your phone\nRinsing your reputation the online way\nMobile working comes of age\nUsing voice to give your app the edge\nBut Microsoft - a company that may well spend more on R&D than any other business - believes its strategy is paying off, and the proof is the XBox Kinect system.\nOn a visit to the company's headquarters, I had a chance to see some of the projects that Microsoft scientists at its laboratories in Redmond, in Beijing and in Cambridge, England, believe will change the way we see computers.\nAnd the striking thing about what Microsoft's research chief Craig Mundie picked to show off to a group of technology journalists was that almost all of them involved Kinect.\nThe system which turns a player's body into a games controller was developed with the help of seven different research groups at the company's three main labs, some working on voice recognition, others on motion sensors and a range of other technologies.\nNow they are looking at what Kinect could do next.\nWe saw a system which would allow two people to see different images on the same screen, their eyes tracked by the Kinect camera.\nOther scientists showed off ways that the camera could capture objects and people in 3D, which might have applications in future telepresence systems.\nAnd there was plenty of work on avatars, for use in either games or in video-conferencing. Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he'll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person.\nCraig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft's R&D strategy is paying off.\n\"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we've been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can't rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\"\nBut Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs.\nEver since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream.\nPeter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking.\nProfessor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis.\nHe cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft's Bing.\n\"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\"\nBut he thinks the long-term research is equally important.\n\"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize.\nHis boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft's big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example.\nThere is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\"\nIt is an intriguing vision, but here's a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line.\nBig, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft.\n\"We don't feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\"\nAnd he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end.\n\"I don't think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren't making these kind of investments. They'll come and go in a generation if they don't have the staying power that's produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\"\nMicrosoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.", "summary": "If you spent $9bn a year on research and development and employed 900 of the world's top computer scientists to come up with new ideas, what would you expect in return?", "id": "12570045"}

(It happened nearly two years ago when China's central bank governor published a series of essays on reserve currencies and reform to the international financial system.)\nThe environment minister's statement is an open call for a paradigm shift away from the model of high input, high resource consumption, and high pollution, to sustainable growth to ease the conflict between economic and social development, and the environmental damage it has caused in the past three decades.\nChinese scholars say China's energy intensity per unit of GDP is at least five times that of Japan. Social stability is another factor as more people are enraged by worsening air, water and soil pollution.\nIt remains to be seen if his call will be translated into real action as China's economic engine roars ahead.\n\"In China's thousands of years of civilisation, the conflict between humanity and nature has never been as serious as it is today,\" he wrote.\n\"The depletion, deterioration and exhaustion of resources and the deterioration of the environment have become serious bottlenecks constraining economic and social development.\"\nChina, he said, would suffer unless issues of air and water pollution were prioritised.\nHe suggested that his ministry should take on a greater role in tackling greenhouse gas emissions and that new development projects  be assessed for their impact on climate change.\nIn recent decades, development has been prioritised over the environment, meaning that China now has some of the most polluted skies and waterways in the world.\nIt relies heavily on coal and is the world's leading CO2 emitter. It overtook the US as the world's biggest car and van market in 2009.\nIn recent years there have been numerous examples of industrial spills or dumping that have damaged waterways and in some cases harmed residents.\nThe BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing says that the government has repeatedly promised to tackle pollution, but then failed to enforced these decisions.", "summary": "The man in charge of protecting China's environment has warned that pollution and the demand for resources threaten to choke economic growth.", "id": "12595872"}

{"document": "LGC Forensics, the biggest commercial provider, said the private sector was ready to take on the work of the FSS, but expressed concern that the forensics market was shrinking.\nThe government announced last year that the FSS would close, with as many of its operations as possible being transferred or sold off.\nThe government wants private enterprise, which currently makes up 40% of the market, to fill the gap left behind by the FSS.\nBut some experts are concerned that an over-emphasis on profits could threaten the quality of science.\nThe FSS analyses evidence from crime scenes in England and Wales, but has been losing about \u00a32m a month.\nIn a written submission to the inquiry, Steve Allen, the managing director of LGC Forensics, commented: \"The closure of the FSS will not damage the prospects for forensic science in the UK so long as its wind-down is properly implemented and is used by the government as an opportunity to support a properly regulated market of a sufficient size to enable competition between dedicated market participants.\"\nThe Home Office has tasked the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) with managing the gradual wind down of the FSS.\nWritten evidence from David Hartshorne and Roger Derbyshire, directors at commercial provider Cellmark, said there would be no negative impacts on the quality or impartiality of forensic evidence.\n\"Forensic scientists in the private sector have exactly the same motivation to support the criminal justice system and the victims of crime as those in the public sector,\" they said.\n\"[Private sector scientists'] ethics and impartiality are independent of the organisation for whom they work; and ultimately, when they stand in the witness box to provide evidence, they are representing themselves rather than the company that employs them.\"\nIn a written response to parliamentary questions on 1 February, Crime Reduction Minister James Brokenshire said advice from ACPO, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and others suggested that the UK forensics market would contract from \u00a3170 million in 2009 towards about \u00a3110 million by 2015.\nIn addition, police forces have been bringing forensic work in-house, in order to make cost savings. And commentators say this could pose an impediment to the future expansion of the private forensics market.\nSome forensic scientists have expressed dismay at the FSS's closure, voicing concerns about the quality of science, the retention of expertise and the future of forensic research and development (R&D) once the service is closed down.\nIn a letter to New Scientist magazine in January, Professor Alec Jeffreys, who pioneered the technique of genetic fingerprinting at the University of Leicester, said the decision to close the FSS could not be in the interests of justice.\n\"Who will provide the expertise for complex and interdisciplinary investigations, and who will develop and refine new technologies? The private sector is most unlikely to fill this void,\" he wrote.\nAs reported by BBC News last month, Peter Gill, professor of forensic genetics at the University of Oslo, said there was a mismatch between the government's aim to commercialise forensic science and the requirement of courts for openness.\nHe added that UK courts would not accept forensic tests whose details were kept secret due to commercial confidentiality issues.\nMr Brokenshire has said that the Forensic Science Regulator should ensure that quality standards are maintained. This course is questioned by Prospect union, which represents scientists and engineers, in their evidence to the inquiry.\n\"Currently the forensic science regulator sits in the Home Office, but... Prospect understands that there are very limited powers and no statutory influence,\" the union wrote.\nIt added: \"Additional regulatory powers will be needed to ensure that there is a level playing field between police forces and private contractors. It will also be essential to ensure that forensic science practitioners have recognisable and respected qualifications and a professional code of ethics.\"\nProfessor Allan Jamieson, director of the Forensic Institute in Glasgow, which is a commercial supplier of forensic services, said there was \"no reason to expect that, if properly managed, this market cannot deliver the required service at a fair price\".\nBut he highlighted the need for the involvement of the wider scientific community in UK forensic science to prevent it from becoming isolated.\n\"It cannot be known whether any provider has met the scientific standard if there is no scientific research to measure the standard against,\" he wrote in his submission.\n\"Perhaps properly funding this essential research is the obvious, logical, and necessary step to prevent the feared decline of standards in forensic science.\"\nThe FSS is headquartered in Birmingham, with a number of laboratories around England and Wales; it has already closed laboratories at Chepstow and central Birmingham to help bring costs under control. The service previously employed about 1,600 staff.\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk", "summary": "The closure of the Forensic Science Service should have no negative impact on criminal justice as long as the wind down is properly handled, commercial providers have told a Commons inquiry.", "id": "12627754"}
{"document": "Several decades later it had become, in the words of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India's \"greatest internal security challenge\".\nMaoists are also known as \"Naxalites\" because of the violent left-wing uprising in 1967, which began in the West Bengal village of Naxalbari.\nAlthough this was eventually quashed by police, over the years India's Maoists have regrouped and asserted control over vast swathes of land in central and eastern India, establishing a so-called \"red corridor\".\nThis spans the states of Jharkand, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh and also reaches into Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka.\nThe Maoists and affiliated groups are active in more than a third of India's 600-odd districts, the authorities say.\nAnd more than 6,000 people have died in the rebels' long fight for communist rule in these states.\nThe Maoists' military leader is Koteshwar Rao, otherwise known as Kishenji.\nHe reportedly suffered temporary paralysis in June 2010 when a police bullet hit him in the knee.\nNormally a regular communicator with the press, Kishenji was little heard of until January 2011 when he issued a statement saying he expected India to succumb to a Maoist revolution by 2025.\nLatest estimates suggest he commandes at least 20,000 armed fighters. They are said to get most of their weapons by raiding police bases.\nAnalysts say the longevity of the Maoist rebellion is partly due to the local support they receive.\nThe rebels say they are fighting for the rights of indigenous tribespeople and the rural poor who they say have been neglected by governments for decades.\nMaoists claim to represent local concerns over land ownership and equitable distribution of resources.\nUltimately they say they want to establish a \"communist society\" by overthrowing India's \"semi-colonial, semi-feudal\" form of rule through armed struggle.\nThe BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta says that while there is little prospect of them making any headway in urban areas - or indeed non-jungle rural areas - the rebels remain a force to be reckoned with in remote areas where the security forces are thin on the ground.\nOur correspondent says the key question now is whether to deploy the army against the rebels in the same way it has been used in Indian-administered Kashmir and some north-eastern states.\nSuch a move would be highly controversial, because it would inevitably been seen by some critics as evidence that the rebels are making headway in what is seen by some as \"mainland India\".\nOver the years the Maoists have managed to launch a series of damaging attacks on Indian security forces.\nIn 2009, rebels gained virtual control of Lalgarh district in West Bengal barely 250km (155 miles) from the state capital, Calcutta.\nFor many months, rebels, supported by local villagers, held hundreds of paramilitary forces at bay. The Maoists declared it to be India's first \"liberated zone\" but Indian security forces finally overwhelmed the rebels.\nApril 2010 saw rebels ambush paramilitary troops in the dense jungles of central Chhattisgarh state, killing at least 76 soldiers. Correspondents say it was the worst-ever Maoist attack on Indian security forces.\nIn 2007, also in Chhattisgarh, Maoist rebels killed 55 policemen in an attack on a remote police outpost.\nAlmost every week, Maoist rebels are blamed for minor skirmishes and incidents across India's north-east - common tactics include blowing up railway tracks and attacking police stations.\nIn 2010, the Maoists faced India's biggest ever anti-Maoist offensive.\nNearly 50,000 federal paramilitary troops and tens of thousands of policemen took part in the operation across several states.\nWhile the rebels were pushed back deep into their jungle strongholds, they have continued to carry out hit-and-run attacks and numerous high-profile kidnappings.\nIndia's government in turn has pledged to crack down even harder unless rebels renounce violence and enter peace talks.\nAt the same time there have been differences not just within the central government over how to tackle the rebellion, but also between Delhi and various Indian states affected by the insurgency.\nExperts say that disagreements over whether to deploy the army against the rebels is a manifestation of these tensions.\nOn one issue however the analysts remain united - the chances of any kind of meaningful dialogue with the rebels in the foreseeable future are slim.", "summary": "India's bloody Maoist insurgency began in the remote forests of the state of West Bengal in the late 1960s.", "id": "12640645"}
