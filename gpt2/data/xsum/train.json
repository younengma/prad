{"document": "The researchers have sequenced the genome of a strain of bacterium that causes the virulent infection.\nA survey in 2007 showed that bleeding canker had spread rapidly, with almost half of the two million horse chestnuts displaying symptoms of the disease.\nThe findings have been published in the journal PLoS One.\nA visible symptom of the disease is a lesion on the bark, which oozes a resin on to the trunk or sometimes the branches.\nThe bark underneath the canker is killed, and if cankers manage to go all the way around the trunk then the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) will die because it cuts off the food supply.\nThe researchers sequenced the genome of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesuli (Pae) from three samples collected from different locations within the UK. They compared them with samples from the only other recorded case, taken from an Indian horse chestnut in India in the 1960s.\n\"What we found was that the three British samples were all identical,\" said co-author Dr David Studholme, currently at the University of Exeter but who was based at The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich, while during the study.\n\"This means that they all probably descended from a single introduction,\" he told BBC News.\nHowever, he added that more work was needed before they could say whether or not the bacterium originated from India, where the pathovar (a strain of bacterium that only affects certain plants, in this case horse chestnuts) was originally recorded.\n\"The Indian [specimen] has only ever been known to cause a leaf spot; there is no evidence of it causing cankers.\"\nDr Studholme's fellow co-author was Sarah Green, a plant pathologist at Forest Research, the research wing of the UK Forestry Commission.

He then relaunched his party as the Movement of the Fifth Republic and made the transition from soldier to politician.\nBy the time Mr Chavez was swept into power in the 1998 elections, the old Venezuelan order was falling apart.\nUnlike most of its neighbours, the country had enjoyed an unbroken period of democratic government since 1958.\nBut the two main parties that had alternated in power stood accused of presiding over a corrupt system and squandering the country's vast oil wealth.\nMr Chavez promised \"revolutionary\" social policies, and constantly abused the \"predatory oligarchs\" of the establishment as corrupt servants of international capital.\nNever missing an opportunity to address the nation, he once described oil executives as living in \"luxury chalets where they perform orgies, drinking whisky\".\nMr Chavez has also frequently clashed with church leaders, whom he accuses of neglecting the poor, siding with the opposition, and defending the rich.\n\"They do not walk in... the path of Christ,\" said Mr Chavez at one stage.\nRelations with Washington reached a new low when he accused the Bush administration of \"fighting terror with terror\" during the war in Afghanistan after 11 September 2001.\nMr Chavez accused the US of being behind a short-lived coup that saw him removed from office for a couple of days in 2002.\nHe survived this episode and emerged strengthened two years later in a referendum on his leadership. He then went on to victory in the 2006 presidential election.\nMr Chavez's government has implemented a number of \"missions\" or social programmes, including education and health services for all.

{"document": "The first-time observation was made on 24 Themis, a huge rock that orbits almost 480 million km out from the Sun.\nThe researchers say that ice is not stable in such circumstances and has to be replenished by some means - perhaps from inside the object.\nThey tell Nature magazine the finding plays into the theory that much of the water in Earth's oceans was delivered from space.\n\"It's interesting that we have detected ice on an asteroid because there have been suggestions that water on Earth came from impacts with many asteroids in Earth's early history,\" said Professor Humberto Campins, from the University of Central Florida, Orlando, US.\n\"This detection of water-ice on the surface of an asteroid supports that idea,\" he told BBC News.\n24 Themis is about 200km in diameter, making it one of the biggest rocks in the main asteroid belt.  It orbits at more than one-and-a-half-times the Sun-Mars distance.\nThe observation that its surface is frosted was confirmed by two independent teams - one led by Professor Campins - who examined how light was reflected off the body using the US space agency's (Nasa) Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.\nThe teams also found a signature for complex organic, or carbon-rich, compounds.\nScientists have long since detected hydrated, or water-containing, minerals on the surfaces of asteroids - but this is a first in terms of an observation of exposed water-ice.\nThe researchers were drawn to make the study because smaller fragments of the rock broken off during an ancient collision look rather like comets when viewed through telescopes, and this suggested they and the larger body might harbour significant quantities of ice.\nBut to find it covering the surface is unexpected, say the researchers. In sunlight, and with no pressure from an atmosphere, the ice would be expected to vaporise rapidly.\nThis indicates the ice disappearing at the surface is constantly being replaced.\nOne scenario thought highly unlikely is that Themis has had a recent collision with an icy comet.\nMore probable explanations are that frequent impacts with smaller rocks are turning over the surface to release hidden reserves of ice, or that vapour from ice held deeper inside the asteroid is continually out-gassing and condensing briefly on the surface.\nTheorists have been concerned for some time that the Earth may have formed at too high a temperature to have started with much water, and it has become a popular theory that much of the water we see today must have come in from elsewhere.\nComets contain a lot of water and impacts could have delivered large volumes.  But perhaps not enough, says Dr Andy Rivkin, from Johns Hopkins University, Laurel, US, who led the other research team.\nAlso, the type of atoms (isotopes) seen in Earth water do not match well a comet-only source.\n\"Finding ice in Themis and the Themis family opens up the possibility that you might have brought in water from asteroids as well as comets; and that potentially allows a lot more water to be brought in and it also allows the isotopic compositions to work out the way we need them to, to match the Earth,\" Dr Rivkin told BBC News.\nAsteroids are a very fashionable topic for scientific study at the moment.\nA Japanese capsule is due to return to Earth in a few weeks with a sample picked up off the surface of a space rock; the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe will flyby an asteroid later this year; and a Nasa spacecraft will go into orbit around one of these bodies in 2011.\nPresident Barack Obama has also directed the US space agency to send astronauts to an asteroid in the mid-2020s.\n\"For a while we thought we knew everything there was worth knowing about asteroids, and we looked farther and farther out into the Solar System, to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and to the Kuiper Belt,\" observed Dr Henry Hsieh from Queen's University Belfast, UK.\n\"Now there seems to be a lot going in the asteroid belt that we don't actually understand, so again these bodies are exciting.\"", "summary": "Scientists have detected water-ice on the surface of an asteroid.", "id": "10090128"}

{"document": "For, as fate would have it, Greece's foes in Group B include the country that last suffered a comparable economic fiasco: Argentina.\nIn the worst-case scenario, Argentina's recent past is Greece's future.\nThe peso collapse, massive default and subsequent social and political unrest that rocked Argentina in 2001-2002 are being seen by many economists as an awful warning for the politicians in Athens and Brussels.\nAs far as football is concerned, the two sides will meet on 22 June. For both teams, it will be their third and final group match.\nBut the day of decision for the Greek economy will come sooner, on 19 May, when the country needs to stave off default by honouring bonds worth 8.5bn euros ($11.2bn; \u00c2\u00a37.3bn).\nThe EU and the IMF have agreed to lend Greece 110bn euros over three years to bail out its stricken economy.\nBut the deal still needs to clear hurdles in the French and German legislatures, while Greece itself must implement severe budget cuts in return for the money.\nAnd, of course, the Greek drama does not end there. The road to recovery will be long and painful, as the country struggles to regain lost competitiveness and get its costs into line with major EU economies.\nEven at first glance, Greece's woes have a lot in common with those of Argentina nearly a decade ago.\nOn the level of gut instinct - which is, after all, the way the markets generally work - the Greek crisis has the same slow-motion train-wreck feel that characterised Argentina's slide into turmoil.\nIn Argentina's case, the government struggled to keep the economy on the rails for most of 2000 and 2001 before President Fernando de la Rua was forced to resign.\nHis replacement, Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, lasted just a week in office. But before stepping down, he triggered a $102bn debt default which the country is still trying to remedy.\nArgentina's current Finance Minister, Amado Boudou, is hoping that its latest debt swap offer, covering $18.3bn of defaulted bonds, will help rebuild relations with world credit markets.\nSince the government is currently unable to borrow on those markets, it has been raiding the central bank's reserves in order to pay off debt - a policy that prompted its boss, Martin Redrado, to resign in January after a bitter public row with President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.\nThat's the kind of disarray that Greece can look forward to unless it manages to get its fiscal house in order.\nBut aside from the protracted nature of Greece's suffering, there are other, deeper parallels between the two countries' predicaments.\nFor a start, they both locked themselves into a currency regime that gave them no flexibility.\nGreece, of course, is in the eurozone, so its monetary policy is decided by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.\nIn contrast, Argentina kept its own currency, the peso. But under the Law of Convertibility, passed in 1991 and not abandoned until January 2002, its value was fixed at parity with the US dollar.\nThat policy was the brainchild of Peronist President Carlos Menem's finance minister at the time, Domingo Cavallo, as a way of restoring the currency's credibility after years of rampant inflation.\nInitially, it worked well - so well that it became an article of faith for the opposition Radical Party, too.\nIn the late 1990s, I interviewed the Radicals' Jose Luis Machinea, tipped for the finance portfolio once the party won the next election.\nHe was adamant that \"convertibility\" would be the cornerstone of his policy - and he kept his word when he got the job in December 1999.\nBut he lasted less than 15 months in office before resigning as the government's efforts to defend the currency peg led to unpopular spending cuts.\nArgentina had let its public debt get out of control, as Greece has now. At the same time, the link to the dollar meant that it suffered from the ups and downs of the US economy, just as the eurozone imposes a one-size-fits-all straitjacket on its diverse economies that stops them devaluing or setting their own interest rates.\nIf Greece is to go down the route of Argentina, it will have to leave the euro and default on most of its debt.\nSince Argentina is still being penalised for that, in terms of its pariah financial status, it scarcely looks attractive.\nWorse still, Greece has much higher debt levels than Argentina did and is less competitive in world markets.\nArgentina clearly has lessons to teach the eurozone. But the UK, too, should pay attention.\nIn the late 1990s, when convertibility was still working for Argentina, there was a feeling among the Buenos Aires elite that the country had genuinely changed and become a more responsible place.\nIn the days of hyperinflation, people had maintained the value of their savings by exchanging their local cash for dollars and hiding them somewhere in their homes.\nThe only bank that was trusted was the \"colchon bank\" - \"colchon\" being Spanish for mattress.\nThat habit briefly abated, but is now back again. Much as Britain never really eliminated boom and bust, so Argentina's essential nature remains unchanged.\nAnd if you want evidence to back up the view recently attributed to Bank of England governor Mervyn King - that the winning party in the UK's general election will have to take such unpopular economic measures that it will be out of power for a generation - look also to Argentina.\nIt might have been Mr Menem's Peronists that pegged the currency and ran up the debt, but the resulting crisis happened on the Radicals' watch - and it almost destroyed them as a political party.\nThis summer, football will provide an exciting diversion for Argentina, Greece and England.

the fifth tier of English football - and on 190 English youth and academy games.\n\"Now you can bet to lose,\" he says, referring to the gambling process known as \"lay betting\".\n\"But if a player bets on his team to lose, even if he is injured, that raises massive integrity issues and affects perception of your sport.\n\"We are trying our best to get the message across - the real issue in football is that there is a very much ingrained culture of betting among players, not just on football matches.\"\nHowever, despite the ease of betting, he does not believe there are FK Pobeda-type cases in English football.\nMr Johnson states that in the past few years, there have only been about 10 cases that the FA has had to investigate, and a couple of cases involving players betting on their own team to lose.\n\"Part of our role is educating players, and we also want to be able to license which games bookmakers can take bets on,\" says Mr Johnson.\n\"With players at youth level being under 18 and more susceptible to pressures, we would not want any betting on these games.\n\"Our role is also to liaise with the Gambling Commission, which regulates commercial gambling, and if a criminal offence is involved, we would not be prosecuting, but would piggyback on a police or commission prosecution.\"\nMr Johnson added that there was a feeling within sport that with gambling firms making large profits, more money could be returned to governing bodies, so that they could use that money for policing and enforcement of possible sporting breaches.\nHorse racing has not been free of controversial incidents in recent years, with a high-profile court case and numerous TV investigations.\nOliver Codrington, head of compliance at the British Horseracing Authority (BHA), is at pains to point out that the industry is \"trying to ensure our sport is free from corruption\".\n\"We have lifted up the rug to see what is underneath,\" he says.\nHis colleague, Paul Scotney, is a former policeman who for six years has been director of sporting integrity at the BHA.\nMr Scotney says that betting on sport has been transformed by the internet from a niche pastime to a \"central leisure pastime for many people, not a peripheral thing\".\nBut he points out that corruption caused by gambling in sport is nothing new, pointing to the case of the the Chicago White Sox baseball team of 1919.\nEight of the team, including Shoeless Joe Jackson, were accused of taking money from gamblers to throw the World Series.\n\"We have to accept that where money is involved, there will be always be someone looking to cheat - we have to make sure they are caught,\" says Mr Scotney.\nAnd, like the FA, Mr Scotney points out the danger that can be done to a sport, even if there is just a perception that something is wrong.\n\"It only needs one event to be talked about for the sport to suffer, that has been seen in some cases in tennis and cricket recently.\"\nMr Scotney highlights five areas that have to be addressed to help ensure clean sport.\nThey are: clear rules and regulations, an investigative and intelligence capacity, robust disciplinary structure, ongoing education programmes, partnership approvals with the betting industry and gambling commission/police.\n\"Investigating suspicious betting patterns is a must,\" he adds. \"Then it can be cleared and the incident in question will no longer be referred to as a suspicious match.\"\nAnd the gambling industry is as keen as its sporting counterparts to ensure that sport is not contaminated by corrupt betting.\nDavid O'Reilly, legal counsel with online gambling firm Betfair, says that his company regularly shares information with sports bodies and the Gambling Commission.\nHis firm also has an eight-person \"integrity\" team, which is part of a bigger anti-money laundering team.\n\"There is common ground between sport and gambling, in that it is in everyone's interest for sport to be clean,\" he says.\nHe adds: \"I don't think it is up to us to say how sports should regulate their players, but education about gambling is a good starting-point.\"\nAnd he says that the firm stores extensive client data -

{"document": "Researchers found that large rodents quickly ate the nuts, rather than caching them, when supplies were scarce.\nWhen supplies were plentiful, almost twice as many nuts were buried, increasing the chance of successful germination, the team added.\nThe findings appear in the Journal of Tropical Ecology.\nThe scientists from Norway, Brazil and the UK said that very little was know about the fate of Brazil nuts under natural condition, despite it being one of the most economically important non-timber crops to come out of Amazonia.\nIn order to get a better understanding of how the seeds were dispersed, they tracked 1,800 marked seeds to see how seasonal food availability affected agoutis' and acouchis' - large scatter-hoarding rodents - caching rates, dispersal distances and how long the seeds were buried before being eaten.\n\"We basically found that the seasons had a very strong effect on the dispersal distances and what happened to the seeds themselves,\" explained Torbjorn Haugaasen, an ecologist at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.\n\"During the wet season (April) - when there are a lot of other fruits in the forest - more seeds were cached for later retrieval,\" he added.\n\"In the dry season (September), on the other hand, more seeds were eaten immediately because there was not that much food around and the rodents needed to draw on the food resource.\n\"Seeds were also taken further away during the dry season, which suggests that the rodents saw them as a more valuable resource than during the wet season,\" Dr Haugaasen told BBC News.\nThe field study, carried out during 2006, showed that 74.4% of seeds were buried during the wet season, compared with just 38.2% during the dry season.\nThe team suggested that collecting too many Brazil nuts from an area could replicate \"dry season\" conditions for the rodents.\n\"Reduced seed availability due to intensive harvesting could potentially create a dry-season scenario where most seeds succumb to pre-dispersal predation, thereby adversely affecting the natural regeneration of Brazil nut trees,\" they wrote.\nThe researchers said that populations of two large rodent species were responsible for the dispersal of the Brazil nut tree seeds: agoutis and acuchis.\nHowever, they added, only the agoutis were capable of gnawing through the hard, thick outer casing of the fruit and releasing the seeds (Brazil nuts).\nAgoutis, which can weigh up to 6kg, are found throughout the same range as the Brazil nut trees in South America.\n\"The (trees) therefore rely almost entirely on these large terrestrial rodents for the release of their well-protected seeds,\" the team explained.\n\"Those seeds not consumed within the germination period (12-18 months) may germinate, and seeds may remain viable for at least six years.\"\nScatter-hoarding also benefits plants in a number of ways, such as transporting seeds away from the parent plants and increasing the probability of reaching a site more suitable for germination.\nDr Haugaasen explained that the team decided to carry out the study in order to build on the findings of a 2003 paper published in Science, which first identified the link between intensive harvesting and the lack of young Brazil nut trees.\nWriting in the 2003 paper, researchers said: \"Persistently harvested stands were characterised by larger (and presumably older) trees and few or no juveniles.\nBut, they observed: \"Juveniles were most common in unharvested and lightly harvested stands.\"\nHowever, Dr Haugaasen said, the people harvesting the nuts could unknowingly be contributing to the regeneration of the trees, as some nuts were accidentally dropped as they were carried out of the forest.\n\"We actually found seedlings along the path used by the collectors. However, this does not mean that they are all going to reach maturity because they are in (vulnerable) places.\"\nBut he warned that restricting nut collecting could prove to be counterproductive because the harvests were a key source of income for local communities.\n\"Alternative possibilities, such as managed planting of seedlings in natural gaps in the forest might be a better solution,\" he suggested.\nDr Haugaasen said that the next step for the researchers was to look at the \"management implications\" of their findings.\n\"We also need to know how the hunting of these rodents can effect the natural regeneration of these trees,\" he added.\n\"You can have a negative impact by reducing the number of these rodents.\n\"However, if you have a large number of seeds already buried by a rodent before it is shot, other agoutis or seed-eaters will not know where those seeds are located.\n\"The seeds may therefore have a higher chance of survival, which could arguably have a positive impact on regeneration.\"\nFurther studies on the ecology of Brazil nut trees are expected to be published in the coming 12 months.", "summary": "A study examining the natural dispersal of Brazil nuts has suggested that intensive harvesting could threaten future regeneration of the trees.", "id": "10105273"}

Their self-confidence hubris is almost impossible to dent.\n\"You can be three or 73 and a Kiss fan,\" declares guitarist Paul Stanley, who along with guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer make up the rest of the band.\n\"Our fans are celebrating our jubilant approach to life and the fact we don't take rubbish from anybody and you can come out a winner.\n\"So they're an army, they're a team, they're a tribe, and as time goes on we become more iconic.\n\"Even with a change of member the band become stronger and it shows that nothing can stop Kiss. \"\nSince the band have been going for 36 years, maybe they've earned their right to their hubris.\nSince their formation in New York during the glam rock era, they've sold a hundred million albums.\nThe original line up of Simmons, Stanley, Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss put on face paint to create four characters - Demon, Starchild, Spaceman and Catman. It's endured and become a trademark.\nThis year they released their first studio album for 11 years, Sonic Boom. It's been acclaimed for its \"original and youthful\" 70s sound - possibly something to do with the band using analogue tapes for the recording.\n\"We did such a successful tour two years ago and the band never felt better,\" explains Stanley.\n\"And there came a time when we looked at each other and thought it shouldn't just be about celebrating our past, and it was time to write another chapter.\n\"Sonic Boom is arguably the best thing we've done in 25 years. It's four people going into the studio and committing to making a great album.\n\"You can't make a great record when you're going, 'How can this band make me more famous?' You've got to think: 'How can I pay tribute to this great institution? And I believe Sonic Boom is a classic album - it's not a retro album at all.\"\nSelf-deprecation isn't in the band vocabulary - but fans don't mind at all. The group have attracted a devoted following known as the Kiss Army.\n\"Without our fans we're nothing,\" says Simmons. \"There is a relationship and love and respect between fan and band that is unequalled.\n\"On the other hand they have the highest expectation. If you think you can go out there, sit on a rug and strum a few songs on an acoustic guitar, good luck to you.\"\nThe fans may love it, but gigs can be an endurance test for the band. Running round in armour and stacked heels is hard at any age - but Simmons is now 60 years old.\n\"Try walking around in these for two and a half hours,\" he says, pointing to his enormous boots.\n\"This is not a sympathy ploy, by the way. We're proud of our energy, we welcome any band that has the courage to get on stage with us. U2, Rolling Stones - we like you very much. Come play with us.\"\nSimmons may also be a reality TV star - his family are in the Gene Simmons Family Jewels series on US TV - but by far the most lucrative part of Kiss's career has been their merchandising.\nThey are the number one merchandise band in the world - selling everything from dolls of themselves, to snooker cues, rubber ducks and even branded coffee.\nThey also helpfully sell fridges which can double up as a coffin for devoted members of the Kiss Army. As Simmons once remarked: \"Planet Kiss sounds a lot better than Planet Earth.\"\n\"Our job is to give the fans what they want,\" argues Stanley. \"It would be selfish of us not to.\n\"When other bands complain about what we do, it's because they're so damn boring that nobody wants one of their T-shirts or a doll or a Mr Potato Head, whatever. We work in a way that if you don't like the merch, don't get it.\"\nSurprisingly for a band so focused on their own product, they confess  they see the UK as \"the holy land\" because it's produced so many of their musical heroes.\n\"We are dyed in the wool Anglophiles,\" maintains Stanley. \"Growing up - we wanted to be in The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Kinks, The Yardbirds, The Pretty Things.\"\n\"Don't forget Slade,\" adds Simmons, with a completely deadpan face.\n\"For a small country - there must be something in the water,\" Stanley continues. \"It's frightening how many great acts come out of the UK.\"\nSimmons agrees: \"Song writing is alive and well over here. Keane write terrific songs, Arctic Monkeys are great.\n\"But we're waiting for stars. We want to see the new Marc Bolan, the new David Bowie before he went all disco - when he was Ziggy, he ruled the world.

The organ is connected to areas of the brain that are involved in memory, emotion and hormonal release.\nIn many mammals, it is already known to detect pheromones, chemical messengers that carry information between individuals of the same species. These pheremones can have a direct effect on animals' behaviour.\nBut in this study, the researchers discovered that, in mice, the neurons in the vomeronasal organ were also stimulated by chemical signals from their predators. These proteins caused the mice to display signs of fear - freezing or keeping close to the ground as they carefully sniffed and investigated their surroundings.\nThe study was led by Professor Lisa Stowers of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.\nShe explained that the discovery made \"perfect sense\" - once animals had evolved a receptor for one type of Mup protein, the underlying genes could enable them to evolve new receptors capable of detecting the proteins produced by other kinds of animals.\nAnd evolving a receptor that detected signals from their predators would help them avoid being eaten.\nWhat surprised Professor Stowers, though, were the results of experiments in which she and her team disabled the vomeronasal organs of mice and then allowed them to interact with an anesthetised, but very much alive, rat.\nUnable to detect the Mups, those mice with no prior experience with rats showed absolutely no evidence of fear at all, even though they could still see the rat right in front of them.\n\"One test mouse curled up and went to sleep next the rat,\" Professor Stowers said. \"We think it was cold.\"", "summary": "Cats, rats and other predators produce a chemical signal that terrifies mice, according to new research.", "id": "10117428"}

{"document": "An investigation by security researchers found the systems to be \"fragile\" and easily subverted.\nThe researchers showed how to kill a car engine remotely, turn off the brakes so the car would not stop and make instruments give false readings.\nDespite their success, the team said it would be hard for malicious attackers to reproduce their work.\nThe team of researchers, led by Professor Stefan Savage from the University of California-San Diego, and Tadayoshi Kohno from the University of Washington set out to see what resilience cars had to an attack on their control systems.\n\"Our findings suggest that, unfortunately, the answer is 'little,'\" wrote the researchers from the Center for Automotive Embedded Systems Security.\nThe researchers concentrated their attacks on the electronic control units (ECUs)scattered throughout modern vehicles which oversee the workings of many car components. It is thought that modern vehicles have about 100 megabytes of binary code spread across up to 70 ECUs.\nIndividual control units typically oversee one sub-system but ECUs communicate so that many different systems can be controlled as the situation demands. For instance, in a crash seat belts may be pre-tensioned, doors unlocked and air bags deployed.\nThe attackers created software called CarShark to monitor communications between the ECUs and insert fake packets of data to carry out attacks.\nThe team got at the ECUs via the communications ports fitted as standard on most cars that enable mechanics to gather data about a vehicle before they begin servicing or repair work.\nThe researchers mounted a series of attacks against a stationary and moving vehicle to see how much of the car could fall under their control.\n\"We are able to forcibly and completely disengage the brakes while driving, making it difficult for the driver to stop,\" wrote the researchers. \"Conversely, we are able to forcibly activate the brakes, lurching the driver forward and causing the car to stop suddenly.\"\nIn one attack, the team transformed the instrument panel into a clock that counted down to zero from 60 seconds.

Both sides will undergo a very big change, especially in social integration,\" said Sung Kuo-chen, a research fellow specialising in Taiwan-China relations at the National Chengchi University in Taipei.\nPresident Ma Ying-jeou and the ruling Kuomintang party believe the agreement is crucial for Taiwan's survival.\nDespite previous government restrictions, in recent years, China has become Taiwan's biggest trade partner, export market and investment destination.\nTwo-way trade exceeds $100bn (\u00a369bn) a year. Around 40% of Taiwan's exports go to China. Taiwanese investments in China have reached $200bn (\u00a3139bn).\nThe trade agreement is therefore needed to protect Taiwanese companies' interests as well as competitiveness, supporters say.\nIf Taiwan's companies cannot enjoy tariff-free trade with China, Taiwan will lose out, because China has signed - or will soon sign - FTAs with its other trade partners, they say.\n\"We can handle diplomatic isolation, but economic isolation is fatal,\" Mr Ma told a news conference recently, referring to Taiwan's inability to join the United Nations or sign free-trade deals with other countries because of objections from China.\nAfter Taiwan signed with Beijing, Mr Ma said, it would be able to negotiate trade deals with others.\nBut it's no surprise the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and many ordinary people are worried about the deal.\nNegotiations on FTAs can be controversial, but this one is especially so because a peace treaty has never been signed between the two sides since they split in 1949 when the Kuomintang lost a civil war to the Communists and fled to the island, located only 180km off China's coast.\nChina still has more than 1,000 missiles targeting Taiwan to warn it against declaring formal independence.\nAnd Beijing has not renounced the use of force to eventually unite with the island it considers one of its provinces.\nOpponents have argued that the trade deal would not only hurt Taiwan's workers and industries by allowing a flood of cheaper Chinese products; it could harm Taiwan's sovereignty by making the island too economically dependent on, and politically vulnerable to, China.\nSome critics have warned it is the first step to annexation of Taiwan by China.\n\"What you are doing now will leave Taiwan's future generations unable to say no to China,\" the DPP's chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen wrote in an open letter to Mr Ma last week.\nSeveral protests against the deal have been organised by the DPP, including a sit-in to mark this week's second anniversary of President Ma taking office.\nTaiwanese people are torn on the issue. Surveys have shown while about 40% favour the ECFA, about 30% do not, and another 30% are undecided.\n\"If we sign with China, we probably won't die. If we don't sign, Taiwan's economy will die,\" a resident of Taichung City said amid a protest in December by tens of thousands of people.\nHis comment reflects the views of many Taiwanese - that Taiwan has no better choice.\nSome see the trade deal as the lesser of two evils.\nOthers fear that closer ties with China could also have an impact on Taiwan's democratic way of life.\nBusinesses with big stakes in China and sectors benefiting from Chinese investments could pressure the government to bow to Beijing.\nCloser ties with China might also make Taiwan's hope of being recognised as a country less likely, but Mr Ma has insisted the agreement has nothing to do with unification.\n\"We will spare no effort to defend the sovereignty of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the dignity of Taiwan,\" Mr Ma pledged during a recent televised debate with Ms Tsai.\n\"We are of course aware of the political ambitions of mainland China toward us during this period, but we cannot let this make us afraid, pull back or avoid trying to move forward,\" he said.\n\"We have confidence in Taiwan, in Taiwan businesses and in Taiwan's democracy.\n\"Trade is Taiwan's lifeblood.

I started with a loan of $340 and now I have $2,800.\"\nBank officials say few people fail to make repayments on these low interest loans while many - especially women - have gone on to commercial success.\nAt the local market in Liberdade, the results of some of this investment can be seen.\nStall owners who, with a bit of a support, have managed to start out their own business, however small the venture.\nHowever the picture is not universally positive.\nA short distance from Ruti's home, thousands of families live in what are called \"palafitas\", houses built on stilts to keep them above water level.\nThe families have little access to even basic sanitation or water, and there is a strong smell from the waste that culminates below the fragile wooden houses.\nChildren play amid the dirt and heavily-armed police officers can be seen patrolling the unpaved lanes.\nNearly 300 families were recently moved out of the area to brightly-painted and newly-constructed flats, but the local residents' association claims this project has stalled, at least for the moment.\nThey also complain that in an area like this it is hard to get access to Bolsa Familia.\nBut analysts say, despite enormous challenges, Brazil is becoming a more equal society.\nBolsa Familia in particular is a cost effective way of helping the poor, says Marcelo Neri, chief economist for social policies at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.\n\"The main thing is that it is a very small fiscal cost,\" he says.\n\"That is the big advantage of Bolsa Familia. You spend 0.4% of GDP, and reach 25% of the population, which are the poorest.\n\"Since they are the poorest, a little money can really make a big change in these people's lives.\"\nIn this year, when Brazil will elect a new president, there seems to be a fairly broad consensus in support of such initiatives, with the only argument about who should get the credit for projects, some of which have been in existence for many years.\nThe government of President Lula insists the investment is much bigger now, and that in recent years 20 million Brazilians have been lifted out of poverty.\nIt remains all too easy to find evidence of the poor social conditions which disfigure large parts of Brazilian life, such as can be found in parts of Liberdade.\nBut a picture is also emerging of a country confronting old problems in new ways, helping to improve the lives of many of its citizens.", "summary": "In the countryside in Maranhao, one of the poorest states in Brazil, life moves slowly in the stifling morning heat.", "id": "10122754"}

But these known differences are much too small to explain why the Universe appears to prefer matter over anti-matter.\nIndeed, these previous observations were fully consistent with the current theory, known as the Standard Model. This is the framework drawn up in the 1970s to explain the interactions of sub-atomic particles.\nResearchers say the new findings, submitted for publication in the journal Physical Review D, show much more significant \"asymmetry\" of matter and anti-matter - beyond what can be explained by the Standard Model.\nIf the results are confirmed by other experiments, such as the Collider Detector (CDF) at Fermilab, the effect seen by the DZero team could move researchers along in their efforts to understand the dominance of matter in today's Universe.\nThe data presage results expected from another experiment, called LHCb, which is based at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva.\nLHCb was specifically designed to shed light on this central question in particle physics.\nCommenting on the latest findings, Dr Tara Shears, a particle physicist at the University of Liverpool who works on LHCb and CDF, said: \"It's not yet at the stage of a discovery or an explanation, but it is a very tantalising hint of what might be.\"\nDr Shears, who is not a member of the DZero team, added: \"It certainly means that LHCb will be eager to look for the same effect, to confirm whether it exists and if it does, to make a more precise measurement.\"\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk", "summary": "A US-based physics experiment has found a clue as to why the world around us is composed of normal matter and not its shadowy opposite: anti-matter.", "id": "10124360"}

Between them they tell the story of modern art's emergence, says the BBC arts editor Will Gompertz.\nHenri Matisse's Pastoral has the hallmarks of the Impressionists - painted outside or \"en plein air\", with loose brushstrokes and an everyday, realistic subject.\nWhat marks it out from the work of the early Impressionists is the bright, unnatural colours, which he has used to express the scene as he sees and feels it.\nThis was called Fauvism.\nGeorges Braque was inspired by the work of Matisse and developed his own Fauvist style which can be seen in the painting Olive Tree Near L'Estaque.\nWhat is of particular interest about this work is the date Braque painted it - 1906.\nThat is the year Paul Cezanne died, and it was his later paintings that inspired Braque to develop one of modern art's most famous movements.\nBy 1907, Braque was painting similar scenes but his style had changed.\nTogether with Picasso they had started to define Cubism.\nPicasso's Dove with Peas makes sense as the next painting to have, as it is a classic example of Cubism in its pomp.\nBy this stage Braque and Picasso had been joined by Fernand Leger as the other great exponent of Cubist art and techniques.\nBut Leger became disillusioned with the increasingly abstract nature of the Cubists' work.\nDuring World War I, he chose to renounce abstraction and instead focus on painting common objects in bold colours.\nAs you can see in the next painting that was stolen - Still Life with Candlestick - Leger has retained the influence of Cubism while incorporating the saturated colours of the Fuaves.\nBut by combining the two and adding his artistic developments the work moves towards modernism.\nAmedeo Modigliani was the fifth artist to be targeted by the thieves.\nThey chose a work he painted in 1919, Woman with Fan.\nHe died a year later at the age of 35, having contracted tuberculosis.\nModigliani's portrait of his friend shows him using restrained colours out of respect for her and using \"S\" shapes to accentuate her graceful pose.\nAs Matisse used colour to express his feelings for his subject, so Modigliani used distortion.\nBoth fit within the expressionist movement inspired by the work of Vincent Van Gogh.", "summary": "Five paintings by Picasso, Matisse and other great artists have been stolen from the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, French officials say.", "id": "10130840"}
{"document": "When it finally came, it was in dramatic form.\nA few bits of rusty scrap metal, unveiled in front of the assembled reporters at a press conference marking the publication of the investigation report.\nEver since the South Korean warship, the Cheonan, was split in half by an explosion and began sinking in the darkness with the loss of 46 lives, North Korea has been the prime suspect.\nBut why has it been so difficult to prove?\nStealth is the name of the game in submarine warfare.\nIt is entirely plausible that a ship, on routine patrol in its own shallow waters, would not pick up any signs of an enemy sub, or even a torpedo fired from one, on its sonar system.\nSo the fact that North Korea was not caught in the act has meant that the investigation team has had to embark on a painstaking and slow process, attempting to piece together what happened by examining the shattered wreck of the ship, salvaged in two pieces from the sea bed.\nIt was announced early on that the Cheonan had been hit by an external \"non-contact\" explosion.\nThat ruled out a simple collision with a rock, or an internal malfunction of the ship's own weapons systems.\nWhatever sank it had exploded underwater, close to the hull of the ship but not in contact with it.\nThat is exactly the way that many torpedoes are designed to work, because exploding a few feet away from the ship causes a far more devastating blow than a direct hit.\nThe trouble for the investigation team was that many sea mines are designed to explode in exactly the same way.\nCould the Cheonan have been sunk as the result of an accidental collision with an unexploded mine left over from the Korean War perhaps?\nIt was crucial to find direct evidence of the type of weapon involved.\nTo that end the South Korean navy even designed its own special nets and they have been dragging them, up to eight times a day, across the seabed close to the site of the sinking.\nJust five days ago, they found what they were looking for - the propellers, a propulsion motor and a steering section of a torpedo, a perfect match for a model known to be manufactured and exported by North Korea.\nThe markings, in Korean script, are said to be consistent with those on a previously obtained model.\nIt was these fragments that were put on display at the news conference. They were clear evidence that the weapon used with such devastating effect was a 1.7 ton torpedo with a net explosive weight of 250kg, and apparent proof of North Korea's involvement.\nThere is other evidence of course.\nThe investigation report says that a number of small submarines, escorted by a support ship, left a North Korean naval base in the Yellow Sea a few days prior to the attack and returned a few days after it took place.\nThe investigation itself was given an added air of impartiality by the presence of 24 foreign experts from America, Australia, Britain and Sweden.  They are all said to support the conclusions reached.\nThe only big question that remains is why?\nUsing a submarine to launch an unprovoked attack on another country's warship is such an extraordinary act of aggression with such serious potential consequences.\nAnd despite the difficulties in obtaining proof after the event as outlined above, such an action certainly runs a substantial risk of detection.\nWhy would North Korea have taken such a calculated risk, and for what purpose?\nSome observers have suggested that it may have been a simple act of retaliation.\nThe Cheonan sank close to the disputed sea boundary between North and South Korean territorial waters, along which the two navies have clashed a number of times in the past decade.\nThe most recent incident, last November, left a North Korean ship in flames, with reported casualties amongst the crew.\nBut torpedoing a warship would be a very dramatic response indeed.\nAnother theory suggests that the incident is a worrying indication of the tensions within the North Korean power structure.\nPerhaps the order was given by the ageing and ailing North Korean leader to keep the military on side.

{"document": "Dr Craig Venter's team announced their landmark discovery in Science magazine.\nThey have succeeded in transplanting synthetic DNA for a bacterium into a host cell.\nBut what are the ethical implications of their discovery?\nWe have now accomplished the last piece on the list that was required to do what ethicists called \"playing God\". What that literally means is the capacity to be a creator.\nThere are a number of people who will find that very fact in itself terrifying. Many believe there ought to be certain areas that ought to be left alone. This is one of those areas where you can do things vastly before you consider their implications.\nThere are obviously very important ethical issues. This work has proceeded without any real regulation at all. The bad guys are out there. Weaponising all sorts of things will be much, much easier.\nThe science is flying 30,000 feet over the public's understanding of the ethics. Scientists can be their own worst enemy by using words like \"clone\" or \"synthetic life\".\nThis isn't a case of rogue scientists, this is a group that is extremely well known, incredibly well respected.\nYou are going to have to help scientists with education so this thing doesn't become a national or international threat.\n[That is] the way to fend off the Luddites that would say this and any other genetic research is awful - these people will be harder to fend off because more safeguards haven't been made.\nA lot of people will think that the main ethical concern is that this is playing God. But the main issue for me is that this has profound and unparalleled potential benefits - developing new biofuels, being able to deal with pollution, new medical treatments - but it also has almost unimaginable potential risks.\nSo far we have seen [elsewhere] the construction of polio and mouse pox but these are just small fry compared to what might happen when you can go down the path of engineering organisms that could never naturally exist.\nI don't think people appreciate the power of this revolution. I don't think the scientists are behaving unethically but this is potentially so powerful we have to think now how we are going to realise the benefits before exposing ourselves to the risk.\nIf this research goes in one direction Dr Venter may get the Nobel prize, but if it goes in another direction there will be no Nobel prizes to give because there will be no people to give them.\nThey are doing significant modifications to the biological matter, but it isn't truly artificial life. Obviously when one engenders a new life form one can't be entirely certain what it's going to do, how it's going to reproduce. It could turn out to be virulent [although that's unlikely in this case].\nUnesco and the UN do have bioethical oversight bodies. This does need oversight - you can unleash new lifeforms that could be quite dangerous.\nWe don't think you can create life. One can modify and manipulate already existing biological material. No-one [is] able to create life from scratch. There have been claims before that life has been created.\nThis is a lovely result.

His claim that we've got the first self-replicating life form whose parent is a computer, that's just silly.\nIt misuses the word \"parent\". The advance here needs to be described in sane and accurate ways.

{"document": "Oops. Luckily the message lasted only a few seconds before normal service was resumed, and so began one of the most anticipated television finales in recent history.\nAnticipated because in the six years since Lost began, it has had the power to enthral and infuriate in equal measure.\nIt launched with what is still the most expensive pilot episode in TV history.\nThe initial concept was pretty simple - a plane crashed on a mysterious island and the survivors soon found themselves locked in a constant battle against The Others - a hostile group of island residents and some kind of monster that lived in the bushes.\nIn series two, we found out that people had been on the island for some time and we learned all about the Dharma initiative.\nAll good so far but then the series seemed to lose its way when it started flashing forward to a future with a dead John Locke, a bitter drug-addicted Jack and the rest of the Oceanic Six living out their \"normal\" lives.\nThe island began time-travelling, half the the gang ended up living as part of the Dharma initiative in 1973, we were introduced to the island's almost mythical protector Jacob as he met the so-called \"candidates\" at points throughout their lives, then there was the return to the island, the Man In Black...\nThe show had become so complex that any rational explanation to the question: \"What is it all about?\" was always going to be a tough one.\nThe cynics questioned whether writers and head honchos Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse had any idea where it was all heading.\nSo, the final episode. The finish line. The finale. The end. Was it all worth it?\nHonestly, the show ended the only way it could have possibly ended. It was emotionally satisfying while some of the questions were answered and yet others will remain a mystery.\nAll in all, the show was wrapped up rather nicely with a positive affirming kind of message.\nIt all began with Flocke (as in Fake Locke, or the Man In Black) having vowed to destroy the island with the help of Desmond, taking him to the island's life source.\nJack, having volunteered to be Jacob's replacement on the island, had the same idea, but rather than using Desmond to destroy the island, he had vowed to kill Flocke.\nDesmond did not end up destroying the island. He came very close but by unplugging the island's light source, he succeeded in making Flocke human, thus allowing Kate to kill him with a shot to the back.\nWas this a bit of a disappointing end to the Man In Black, the chief antagonist of the last season? Possibly, and a slightly unfair one as well.\nThe Man In Black (he never even got a name) certainly got a bit of a raw deal when goody-two shoes Jacob threw him into the light source some two thousand years earlier, robbing him both of his body and his humanity.\nWas he all bad? He certainly was a bit of a trouble-maker who carried out a few terrible deeds. But in the Across the Sea episode of season six - we saw a man who saw the limitations of his life on island and saw his destiny elsewhere.\nBy killing him, there, was no chance of his redemption.\nAlso, surely killing him resulted in a loss of balance on the island. All of Lost's imagery pointed to good and bad co-existing, the black and white stones, the struggle between light and dark.\nIn the struggle that preceded the fatal shooting, Jack was mortally wounded and resolved to stay and repair the island. Hurley went with him and Jack made him his successor as island protector.\nMeanwhile, Sawyer, Kate, Claire, Miles, Richard and Lapidis managed to get the plane working with the help of some duct tape and flew off the island to safety.\nMeanwhile, the flashes sideways continued as the survivors were all drawn together at the music concert at the Widmores.\nLocke had accepted Jack's offer of surgery and was now capable of walking unaided. Hurley took Sayid to a bar where - after stopping a fight - he was reunited with Shannon.\nSun and Jin were reminded of their time on the island as they saw the ultrasound of their baby and Sawyer and Juliet met again in a touching scene by a snack machine.\nAs early as the first season, there were suggestions that no-one survived the plane crash and the island was some sort of purgatory.\nClose but no cigar. The island was real and as Jack's dad Christian Shephard ( ... Kate was the one that spotted it. Really how did we all miss that one?) pointed out \"everything that happened, happened\".\nInstead, we learned that rather than being some some kind of alternate-timeline, the flashes sideways were glimpses of a kind of limbo between life and death.\nIn their deaths - some on the island, some much, much later - they were all pulled together to move on to the afterlife.\nThe people that meant most to them during their lives would be there with them as they moved on to the next plane of existence.\nWith various philosophies running throughout the entire series, the final scenes took place in a multi-denominational place of worship.\nThere were some genuinely moving touches, Ben remained outside the gathering, not quite ready to leave his own personal purgatory and forgive himself for his sins.\nYet Locke did offer him gratefully accepted forgiveness and Hurley, who invited Ben into the gathering said he was a \"good number two\", with Ben telling Hurley he was a \"great number one\".\nWe were left to assume that the two men acted as protectors of the island for some time.\nIt ended as it had begun with Jack lying in the same bamboo forest in which we first met him in episode one. Back then Jack opened his eyes for the first time on the island, this time around he closed them for the last.\nYes, the finale could be accused of being a bit melodramatic and certainly there were many issues left unaddressed.\nWhatever happened to Michael and Walt? What was the significance of the Egyptian statue on the island? What about the temple? Why, at the beginning of this series, was the island underwater?\nDiscussions will likely rage for years to come but if there is any lesson from the final episode, then it is that sometimes you just have to let go.", "summary": "At 0500 BST, about 30 seconds after an on-screen message saying UK viewers were watching Lost: Live from the US - its first and last simultaneous UK/US broadcast - another screen popped up reading Temporary Fault.", "id": "10146072"}

It appears that this was a very early example of an industrial settlement, with only very basic barrack-style accommodation.\n\"The principal industry seems to have been processing sugars and oil from dates, and given that they're not native to the region, they must have been brought in by sea, probably from the world's biggest oasis in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, measuring over 100 miles end to end.\"\nHe said the whole site was \"baffling\".\n\"Despite being located on the coast, there's none of the artefacts you'd expect to find, connected with fishing or pearl diving.\n\"Also, given that it's on a natural deep water harbour, rare on the Qatari coast, it's strange that there's no evidence of even more extensive trade links with the outside world.\n\"The best theory we can come up with at the moment is that Rubayqa was used as some sort of processing and storage facility for nomadic tribes who'd stock up there before wandering the deserts of the Arabian hinterland.\"\nAlmost as big a mystery surrounds who lived or worked there, and why they abandoned it.\nDr Petersen believes that documentary evidence in Turkey points towards an Ottoman Empire outpost in the area, from as early as the 15th Century.\nIt is thought that the Ottomans seized territory to use as a base from which to invade neighbouring Bahrain.\nQatari sources point to a major attack on Rubayqa during the 1760s by the Wahhabi tribe from what is now Saudi Arabia.\nThe last human occupation of the site has been dated from remains as being around the 1890s, but why it was finally left to the sands is unclear.\n\"We suspect that there was another major assault on Rubayqa in the 1890s, possibly even larger than the attack during the 1760s,\" Dr Peterson added.\n\"We've found burnt roofing timbers on top of day-to-day objects, which would suggest that the fires occurred suddenly, and while the buildings were still occupied.\n\"This is probably why the inhabitants fled, but who attacked them, and why they never came back is a mystery which can only be revealed through further excavations over the next few years.\"", "summary": "A Welsh academic has revealed how he discovered a Middle East settlement buried under sand for about 125 years.", "id": "10148297"}

{"document": "And now they will not even make it to their first birthday as the coalition government is to scrap the entire project - the cards and the corresponding national identity register.\nThe Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have long opposed the scheme and say they want to reverse what they see as \"an erosion of civil liberties\" under Labour.\nHere's how the ID cards evolved and what was said about them:\nHome Secretary David Blunkett outlines plans for a national identity card - the first in the UK since wartime identity documents were abandoned over 50 years ago. A six-month consultation is launched.\nLabour had mooted the idea before as a way of combating terrorism after 9/11, but now it was being billed as an \"entitlement card\"  to combat benefit fraud and illegal workers.\nThe Home Office estimates the cost of introducing an entitlement card would be between \u00a31.3bn and \u00a33bn - the higher estimate would be for a card incorporating state-of-the-art iris or fingerprint recognition.\nMr Blunkett's Tory predecessor Michael Howard had wanted to introduce a national identity card scheme but shelved the idea until after the 1997 election, which the party lost.\nLabour hints it may drop the idea of \"entitlement cards\" amid mounting opposition from civil liberty groups and concerns about cost.\nOpponents say that, intentionally or not, identity cards would single out Britain's minority communities.\nThe results of the public consultation are in and the Home Office admits that more than 5,000 of the 7,000 responses were against the scheme.\nMr Blunkett says he wants a bill for the introduction of the cards to be included in the Queen's Speech. PM Tony Blair appears to back the idea but the Cabinet is split.\nMr Blunkett said they would ensure \"people don't work if they are not entitled to work, they don't draw on services which are free in this country, including health, unless they are entitled to\".\nHe said it would also mean \"when we find people we can identify quickly that they are not entitled and get them out\".\nMr Blunkett gets his wish as measures to create a national identity card system are announced in the Queen's Speech. But it has been delayed until later in the decade to include biometric data. It is suggested ID cards may be compulsory in the UK by 2013.\nMr Blunkett suggests the card would cost \u00a335, and says they will aid counter-terrorism, stop illegal working, cut benefit fraud and abuse of public services, and prevent identity theft.\nEarlier in the month, Met Commissioner Sir John Stevens calls for the urgent introduction of a compulsory identity card as an \"essential\" weapon  in the fight against terrorism.\nPlans to combine new compulsory identity cards with passports and driving licences are dropped. A free-standing card is considered the most attractive option.\nID cards bill is launched. Under the revised proposals a national database will be created holding personal information such as names, addresses, and biometric information for all those who are issued with a card.\nThe Home Office says people will pay \u00a385 for a passport and ID card together or an undecided fee for a separate ID card.\nThe first cards would be issued in 2008 and Mr Blunkett suggests Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own one, although not to carry it.\nAfter Mr Blunkett's resignation, the new Home Secretary Charles Clarke vows to plough on with plans for ID cards.\n\"ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society,\" he said.\nAfter several defeats in the House of Lords, a compromise is reached and the Identity Cards Act became law.\nRollout of compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals begins, replacing paper documents.\nAn 18-month trial involving workers at Manchester and London City airports is proposed but is met with union opposition.\nHome Secretary Alan Johnson drops plans to make ID cards compulsory for pilots and airside workers at Manchester and London City airports.\nMr Johnson admits the cards should not have been sold as the \"panacea for tackling terrorism\" which he said had been responsible for \"messing up\" the debate.\nIdentity cards are unveiled but Mr Johnson says they will not be compulsory for UK citizens.\nThe government had originally wanted them to be compulsory (though that would have required a vote in Parliament).\nBut it is still pressing ahead with the main elements of the ID card scheme - from 2011, British citizens aged 16 over who apply for a passport will automatically be registered on the national identity database.\nPeople living in Greater Manchester become the first UK residents able to buy an identity card. The biometric ID card costs \u00a330 and can be used to travel passport-free across the EU.\nThe ID card should be available nationwide in 2011 or 2012.\nScheme extended across NW England.\nID cards available to 16 to 24-year-olds in London.\nA total of 15,000 cards are in circulation. But the cards will soon be useless as the coalition announces it will scrap the scheme. It is said to have cost \u00a35bn, although the London School of Economics has said the true bill would be between \u00a310bn and \u00a320bn.\nThe ID card system for foreign nationals from outside the European Economic Area will remain in place.

Facebook will suggest defaults.\nAs with the changes made in December, users will be able to choose to share their applications with just friends, friends of friends or everyone.\n\"We've focused on three things: a single control for your content, more powerful controls for your basic information and an easy control to turn off all applications,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at Facebook's Palo Alto headquarters.\nPeople who want more \"granular control\" will still be able to access existing settings.\nFacebook has also reduced the amount of information that is visible to everyone.

{"document": "The two countries were close allies, but relations broke down after the killing by Israeli commandos of 10 Turkish activists on board a ship that was part of an aid flotilla attempting to breach the blockade of Gaza on 31 May 2010.\nThe six ships in the flotilla were boarded in international waters, about 130km (80 miles) from the Israeli coast. Commandos landed on the largest ship, the Turkish-owned Mavi Marmara, by descending on ropes from helicopters. Clashes broke out immediately and the Israeli commandos opened fire.\nThis is disputed. The activists say the commandos started shooting as soon as they hit the deck. Israeli officials say the commandos opened fire only after being attacked with clubs, knives and a gun which was taken from them. Video released by the Israeli military stops just before the shooting begins. A UN inquiry was apparently unable to determine at exactly which point the commandos used live fire.\nThey were all Turkish, although one had dual Turkish-US nationality. All were travelling on the Mavi Marmara.\nIt wanted to deliver aid to Gaza, breaking an Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the territory.  The ships were carrying 10,000 tonnes of goods, including school supplies, building materials and two large electricity generators. The activists also said they wanted to make the point that, in their view, the blockade was illegal under international law.\nGaza Movement, an umbrella organisation for activists from numerous countries, and a Turkish group called the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Aid (IHH).\nThe Israeli government says the IHH is closely linked to the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which it views as a terrorist group, and is a member of another organisation, the Union of the Good, which supports suicide bombings. However, the Turkish government regards the IHH as a legitimate charity, and had urged Israel to let the flotilla through.\nIsrael prevents a large range of goods from reaching Gaza in order to put pressure on Hamas, which dominates the territory.\nIsrael also wanted to check that the ships did not contain deliveries of weapons or cash. It offered to allow the flotilla to land in an Israeli port, and to deliver by road any goods that passed its checks.\nSome flotillas have been allowed to reach Gaza in the past; others have been sent back.\nThere was widespread condemnation of the violence. The UN Security Council issued a statement calling for a \"prompt, impartial, credible and transparent\" inquiry.\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged Israel to lift the Gaza blockade.\nIn September 2010, a UN Human Rights Council report said Israel's military broke international laws, that the action by commandos, which left nine dead, was \"disproportionate\" and \"betrayed an unacceptable level of brutality\".  Israel rejected the report as \"biased\" and \"one-sided\".\nIsrael and Turkey held their own inquiries, submitting the findings to an international panel set up by the UN, chaired by a former New Zealand Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, and including an Israeli member and Turkish member.\nTurkey's report, drawn up by government officials, accused Israeli commandos of \"excessive, brutal and pre-meditated\" conduct.  It concluded their action boarding the Mavi Marmara was \"unlawful\" and breached human rights. Results of post-mortem examinations had earlier suggested a total of 30 bullets were found in the bodies of the dead activists, including one who had been shot four times in the head. The Turkish panel also deemed the Gaza blockade \"unlawful\".\nThe Israeli inquiry, headed by Judge Jacob Turkel, and including five Israeli members and two international observers, found the actions of the navy and Israel's blockade of Gaza were legal under international law. However, it offered some criticism of the planning of the military operation. It also referred to \"the regrettable consequences of the loss of human life and physical injuries\".\nIn September 2011, the UN panel concluded in a repeatedly-delayed report that the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force by Israeli troops was \"unacceptable\".\n\"Israel's decision to board the vessels with such substantial force at a great distance from the blockade zone and with no final warning immediately prior to the boarding was excessive and unreasonable,\" it said.\nHowever, the commandos did face \"significant, organised and violent resistance\", requiring them to \"use force for their own protection\", the panel found.\nNevertheless, no satisfactory explanation was provided by Israel for any of the deaths, and the \"forensic evidence showing that most of the deceased were shot multiple times, including in the back, or at close range\" was not accounted for, the report said.\nThere was also \"significant mistreatment\" of passengers by Israeli authorities after the takeover of the vessels, including physical mistreatment, harassment and intimidation, unjustified confiscation of belongings and the denial of timely consular assistance, it added.\nAt the same time, the panel said that the Israeli naval blockade on Gaza was imposed as a \"legitimate security measure\" to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law. The flotilla acted \"recklessly\" in attempting to breach the naval blockade of Gaza, and more could have been done to warn flotilla participants of the potential risks involved and to dissuade them from their actions, according to the report.\nIn November 2014, a preliminary examination by the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor concluded that it should not take further action despite a \"reasonable basis to believe that war crimes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 were committed\", because it had to prioritise war crimes on a larger scale.\nThe flotilla incident caused a deep rift between the former allies.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the flotilla raid, Turkey withdrew its ambassador from Tel Aviv and then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for Israel to be punished for its \"bloody massacre\".  Joint military exercises were also cancelled.\nFollowing the publication of the Palmer report, which was delayed several times as diplomats tried to repair relations, Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador in Ankara.\n\"The time has come for Israel to pay for its stance that sees it as above international laws and disregards human conscience,\" Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said. \"The first and foremost result is that Israel is going to be devoid of Turkey's friendship.\"\nThe Turkish government had insisted on receiving an Israeli apology by the time the report was released.\nIsraeli officials noted that the UN report did not demand a full apology, establishing only that Israel should issue an \"appropriate statement of regret\" and \"offer payment for the benefit of the deceased and injured victims and their families\".\n\"Israel, like any other country, has a legitimate right to protect its citizens and soldiers,\" an Israeli government official told the BBC.\nIn November 2012, a court in Istanbul began trying in absentia four retired Israeli commanders over the raid. Among the charges was \"inciting murder through cruelty or torture\".\nThe accused were named as Israel's former military chief of staff, Gen Gabi Ashkenazi, former naval chief Vice-Admiral Eliezer Marom, former head of military intelligence Maj Gen Amos Yadlin, and former head of the air force Brig Gen Avishai Lev.\nThe Israeli embassy in Ankara called the trial a \"unilateral political act with no judicial credibility\".\nIn March 2013, Israel and Turkey's prime ministers unexpectedly agreed to restore normalise diplomatic relations and end the legal action against former Israeli commanders.\nThe breakthrough came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Mr Erdogan in a telephone conversation brokered by US President Barack Obama during a visit to Israel.\nA statement from Mr Netanyahu's office said he had \"made it clear that the tragic results regarding the Mavi Marmara were unintentional and that Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life\".\n\"In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational errors, Prime Minister Netanyahu apologized to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation,\" it added.\nMr Erdogan, who became Turkey's president the following year, said they had also \"agreed on making arrangements for compensation\" to the victims' families, adding that he had \"accepted the apology in the name of the Turkish people\".\nIn June 2016, Turkey and Israel agreed to normalise their relations.\nOfficials said the reconciliation deal would see Israel pay $20m in compensation to the families of those killed on the Mavi Marmara; Turkey allowed to deliver aid to Gaza via an Israeli port; and Turkish infrastructure projects aimed at improving the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory.\nIn return, Turkey agreed to pass legislation protecting Israeli troops from legal claims, and to prevent any military action or fundraising by Hamas operatives based there.", "summary": "Israel and Turkey have announced an agreement to end an acrimonious, six-year diplomatic rift.", "id": "10203726"}

A cluster of nine SpaceX-developed Merlin-1C engines will power the rocket off the pad.\nA single Merlin on the second stage will complete the task of pushing the payload into orbit.\nFor its maiden flight, the Falcon 9 carried a cut-down version of its Dragon freighter - a blunt-nosed, 3.7m-wide capsule that will collect engineering performance data during the ascent.\nOn future flights, Dragon will be filled with supplies for the International Space Station.\nHistorically, the maiden flights of rockets have a notoriously high failure rate.  Some two-thirds of the rockets introduced in the past 20 years have had an unsuccessful first outing.\nMillionaire Elon Musk set up SpaceX in 2002 and has already flown a much smaller rocket called the Falcon 1.\nTo keep costs as low as possible, the Falcon 9 uses many of the same components and systems, including its kerosene/liquid-oxygen-burning Merlin engines.\nSpaceX was awarded a $1.6bn contract by Nasa in 2008 for up to 12 Falcon/Dragon missions to the ISS.\nThe Dragon freighter, once operational, is expected to be capable of hauling six tonnes of food, water, air and equipment to the platform.\nThe company says it has designed Dragon in such a way that it can be converted relatively easily into a crew ship, if Nasa so desires it.\nThe company claims that it would be ready to launch astronauts on the Falcon within three years of being given an ISS taxiing contract.\nHowever, other space companies and their rockets will almost certainly be in competition for such work, including some of the established industry names like Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\nSpaceX hopes the Falcon 9 can also take a sizeable share of the commercial satellite launch market.\nIt is quoting prices to put large telecommunications spacecraft in geostationary orbit that dramatically undercut current sector leaders, such as Europe's Ariane 5 and Russia's Proton vehicles.\nBut Rachel Villain from the respected space analysts Euroconsult said many in the satellite business were being cautious about SpaceX's future prospects.\n\"This is not new in the industry,\" she told BBC News.\n\"When we had the maiden flight of Ariane 4, when we had the maiden flight of Atlas 3, the maiden flight of Delta 4 - all these vehicles promoted a good price for the company taking the risk of being on an early launch.

Not everyone could be a Spitfire Pilot, but they all did their part, and their stories deserve to be heard.\"\nThe Rhydymwyn tunnels were bored into the hillside during 1939, with the express purpose of storing stock-piles of mustard gas.\nImperial War Museum records show that the mustard gas shells processed in the adjacent munitions factory and stored underground in the tunnels would have been used in a carpet-bombing campaign on south-east beaches to poison an invading German army had they followed the British across the Channel in June 1940.\nAs the threat of invasion began to fade, by 1942 attention at Rhydymwyn turned to another form of deadly weapon, in the hunt to enrich uranium for an atom bomb.\n\"The things we're discovering aren't only relevant to Rhydymwyn, they have resonance across the globe,\" said Mr Barber.\n\"There's also evidence that the research conducted into uranium enrichment here, contributed directly to the Manhattan Project which came up with the H-Bomb to end the war in the Pacific.\"\nWhilst the authorities have been comparatively keen to assist in the project, when it came to the war-time activities  government departments have consistently stone-walled any attempts by to learn what took place after Britain acquired nuclear weapons technology.\nA Freedom of Information request was refused, as was the appeal, so the Rhydymwyn Valley History Society was forced to take the government to a tribunal, which finally ruled in their favour.\nAmongst the documents released was a letter from the Treasury, to the Cabinet Office in Whitehall, detailing plans to ship about 4,000 tons of gold to Rhydymwyn in the event of an imminent nuclear strike.\nIt was to be moved anonymously in up to 500 unmarked 10-ton trucks, in an operation which would have taken around 10 to 15 days to complete.\nOnce at Rhydymwyn, the gold would have been stacked in the tunnels in eight-feet-high piles.\nAn area was cleared on the surface for heavily armed troops to guard what would have amounted to a third of the nation's wealth.\nMr Barber said: \"The assumption was that if the worst happened, then lines of credit were going to dry up, and that food, weapons, provisions etc would have to be paid for up front with gold.\n\"Around two thirds of Britain's overall reserves would have been out of reach abroad, so Rhydymwyn would have stored literally the only source of wealth open to the government.\"\nBut perhaps most interestingly of all, the documents released to The Rhydymwyn Valley History Society have no less than 42 redactions.\nFor Mr Barber and his team there are yet more secrets to uncover at Rhydymwyn.", "summary": "Local historians in a small corner of Flintshire have uncovered more of the colourful history of a classified government site built before the start of World War II.", "id": "10218941"}

The other 60% are Dutch speakers who live in the Flemish north.\nTo add confusion, the capital Brussels is officially a bilingual (but largely francophone) enclave in Flemish territory.\nThe linguistic gulf runs deep. There are no national political parties - they too follow the language split, so there are both francophone and Flemish Liberal, Socialist, Christian Democrat and Green parties.\nLikewise, there are no national broadcasters, no national newspapers or magazines.\nThe Belgian state is already highly decentralised. Education, health, and transport are all the responsibility of powerful regional parliaments.\nTo make the system work, politicians from both communities have to co-operate. But in recent years that co-operation has broken down.\nSome politicians from the wealthier Flemish region are pushing for even more autonomy, for example by taking control of the social security system.\nFrench speakers from the more impoverished south fear that would mean the country breaking up.\nThese elections were called when - for the third time in as many years - the government collapsed.\nThe trigger was a complex argument over voting rights for French speakers living in Flemish towns on the outskirts of Brussels.\nThey have been allowed to vote for French language parties in the Brussels region, even though they live in a Flemish area.\nThe Constitutional Court ruled that was illegal.

This could also point to early Mars being warmer than previously thought.\n\"It looks like Mars had a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere, so there was some kind of greenhouse effect,\" said Dr Morris. \"The atmosphere now is very thin, - it could have blown into space or it could have interacted with water and is now present in the rocks.\"\nThe carbonate is also evidence that the water was chemically neutral, which would have made conditions \"more permissive\" for life on early Mars.\nWhile none of this is direct evidence of life on Mars, Dr Morris says the study is \"just the beginning\" of the science that will be possible with this data.", "summary": "The Red Planet harbours rocks rich in carbonate minerals, suggesting there was more water there in the past than previously thought, say scientists.", "id": "10231374"}

He pointed out that people tend to \"kill cockroaches rather than study them\".\n\"I can understand that,\" he told BBC News. \"But it means we don't know very much about their behaviour.\"\nIt was generally accepted that the insects foraged individually, \"but that's definitely not true,\" said Dr Lihoreau. \"Anyone who has cockroaches in their home will tell you that's wrong - you see them in groups.\"\nTo test his suspicion that the creatures were in fact communicating with each other, he and his colleagues gave a group of cockroaches a food choice test.\n\"We released them into a small arena where there were two identical food sources,\" he explained. \"If they didn't communicate, we would expect that they should just distribute on the two food sources equally.\"\nBut the majority of the hungry cockroaches (Blattella germanica) fed solely on one piece of food until it was all gone.\nBy following individual insects, it also emerged that the more of cockroaches there were on one piece of food, the longer each one would stay to feed.\n\"We don't know how they communicate, but we know they're using chemicals,\" Dr Lihoreau explained. \"That will be the next step - to find the chemicals involved in the communication.\n\"These observations coupled with simulations of a mathematical model indicate that cockroaches communicate through close contact when they are already on the food source.\"\nHe believes that the insects signal to each other using a \"foraging pheromone\" - possibly a chemical in their saliva or a hydrocarbon on their bodies.\n\"We think they encounter another cockroach, touch it and say 'ok, that's another cockroach, its eating good food, I'll stay',\" he said.\nOnce identified, a man-made foraging pheromone could be used to improve pest control, making insecticide gels more effective or be used to create an insecticide-free trap.", "summary": "Cockroaches \"recommend\" good food sources to each other by communicating in chemicals, according to scientists.", "id": "10236515"}

They had been taken by his official photographer Heinrich Hoffmann.\n\"I'm looking forward to finding the cards relating to rubber and ball bearings and how the Germans gathered these materials.\n\"The Germans developed synthetic rubber as they found it hard to get natural rubber. They also needed lots of ball bearings for the war effort, which is why the allied forces attacked a lot of ball bearing factories.\"\nHe said there were records in the archive which showed countries such as Spain, Switzerland and Sweden were perhaps not as neutral as they were portrayed.\n\"It is quite clear there was a lot of correspondence going on between these countries,\" he said.\nHe said the volunteers had already unearthed records showing countries including  Spain dealing in diamonds with the Japanese and other German allies.\nHe said more information about the double agent Garbo - a Spaniard whose real name was Juan Pujol Garcia - was likely to come out once the work on the archive began.\nGarbo, who has been described as World War II's \"greatest double agent\", persuaded the Nazis that the allied forces were planning their D-Day operation in Calais rather than Normandy.\nHe said he was also expecting more information about the fuel the Germans were discovered to be sending to Peenemuende, a small village close to the Baltic Sea.\nHe said: \"We didn't know anything about it initially, but then because of the message that Bletchley Park decoded, the allies sent a reconnaissance aircraft and they found out that rockets - weapons of terror - were being developed there.

All that is ideal for sponsors.\"\nHe says other global events such as Formula 1 motor racing or even the Olympics do not offer the same opportunities to sponsors.\n\"There are not many global events of this size. It is not just about putting up a billboard, it is about creating worldwide exposure.\n\"I think that the key thing is that these sorts of companies that are partnering Fifa have all learned how to use major global events to grow business.\n\"Every can or bottle of Coca Cola has the logo on it.
